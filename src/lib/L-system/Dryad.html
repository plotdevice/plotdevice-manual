    <p>Frederik has rewritten his Dryad-typeface as a PlotDevice script (the original interactive
    version was in <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>, you can play with it at <a href="http://igor.grafitron.com/dryade/">http://igor.grafitron.com/dryade/</a>).</p>

    <p><em>The letter S</em></p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>Dryad is a typeface that <em>grows</em> words: a single character is made up of many of the
    next character in the word, and that character is made up of many of the next character, and so
    on.</p>
    <p>This principle is called recursion, defining things in terms of themselves. Recursion occurs
    in nature as well as in programming, for example, a tree could be described as a big branch
    which has smaller branches... a definition which is true for any part of the tree, from the
    stem to the smaller twigs.</p>
    <p>Dryad’s algorithm is a so-called Lindenmayer-system (or <strong>L-system</strong>), a
    recursive system of rules and symbols used in biology and artificial life to describe plant
    growth and development.</p>
    <p>I’ve included <a href="http://nodebox.net/code/data/media/dryad.mov">an animation</a> of the
    letter Z growing, very cool!</p>
