    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>In mathematics and computer science, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a> studies networks of connected
    nodes and their properties. A graph can be used to visualize related data, or to find the
    shortest path from one node to another node for example.</p>
    <p>Central concepts in graph theory are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Node</b>: a block of information in the network.
      </li><li><b>Edge</b>: a connection between two nodes (can have a direction and a weight).
      </li><li><b>Centrality</b>: determining the relative importance of a node.
      </li><li><b>Clustering</b>: partitioning nodes into groups.
    </li></ul>

    <p>The PlotDevice Graph library includes algorithms from <a href="https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki">NetworkX</a> for betweenness centrality and eigenvector
    centrality, Connelly Barnes’ implementation of Dijksta shortest paths (<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/119466">here</a>) and the spring
    layout for JavaScript by Aslak Hellesoy and Dave Hoover (<a href="http://snipplr.com/view/1950/graph-javascript-framework-version-001/">here</a>). The goal of
    this library is visualization of small graphs (&lt;200 elements), if you need something more
    robust we recommend using NetworkX.</p>
    <p><span class="pink_text">For those of you looking for the old Graph library built on Boost,
    it can still be found <a href="http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Boost_Graph">here</a>.</span><br/></p>

    <h2><a id="loading_the_library" name="loading_the_library" title="loading_the_library"></a>How
    to get the library up and running</h2>

    <p>Put the <i>graph</i> library folder in the same folder as your script so PlotDevice can find
    the library. You can also put it in <i>~/Library/Application Support/PlotDevice/.</i></p>
<pre>graph = ximport("graph")
</pre>

    <p><span class="small_text">Outside of PlotDevice you can also just do <i>import graph.</i></span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <hr size="2" width="100%"/>

    <h2><a id="create" name="create" title="create"></a>Creating a graph</h2>
<pre>create(iterations=1000, distance=1.0, layout="spring", depth=True)
</pre>

    <p>The <i>create()</i> command returns a new <i>graph</i> object encompassing the drawing
    canvas. The network of connected nodes will originate from the center of the canvas. The
    <i>distance</i> parameter controls the spacing between nodes and hence the size of the
    graph.<br/></p>
    <p>By default, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-based_algorithms">spring force</a>
    <i>layout</i> is used to visualize the graph. Each element in the graph (or <b>node</b>) will
    try to get away as far as possible from the others. This is the <i>repulsive force</i> in the
    network. At the same time, there are connections (or <b>edges</b>) that keep nodes together.
    The greater the weight of an edge the stronger it is in pulling two nodes together. This is the
    <i>attractive force</i> in the network. You can also set the <i>layout</i> parameter to
    ‘circle’ to use a simple circle-based layout.<br/></p>
    <p>The forces in the network need to be calculated several times in order for the nodes’
    positions to stabilize. The higher the number of <i>iterations</i> the better (but slower) the
    layout.

    <p>You can add nodes (e.g. blocks of information you want to connect) to the graph with the
    <i>graph.add_node()</i> method. The <i>id</i> parameter <b>uniquely</b> identifies each node,
    it will appear as a label on each node once the graph is visualized. When the <i>root</i>
    parameter is <i>True</i> it will set this node as the graph’s root.</p>
    <p>The <i>graph.add_node()</i> method returns a node object with the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>node.id</i>: the node’s unique id.

    <p>We’ll look at the details of a node’s weight and traffic in the section on <a href="#proximity">graph proximity</a>.</p>
    <p>You can connect two nodes with the <i>graph.add_edge()</i> method. It takes two node id’s,
    an optional <i>weight</i> (ranging between 0.0 and 1.0) and an optional <i>label</i> to display
    near the edge when it is drawn.<br/></p>
    <p>An <i>edge</i> object is returned. It has the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>edge.node1</i>: the <i>node</i> object from which the connection originates.
      </li><li><i>edge.node2</i>: the <i>node</i> object in which the connection ends.

    <h2><a id="remove" name="remove" title="remove"></a>Retrieving/removing nodes and edges</h2>

    <p>The <i>graph</i> object has <i>graph.nodes</i> and <i>graph.edges</i> properties that list
    all of the nodes and connections it contains. It also has a <i>graph.node()</i> and a
    <i>graph.edge()</i> method that returns nodes and edges based on id’s:</p>
<pre>graph.node(id)
</pre>
<pre>graph.edge(id1, id2)
</pre>

    <p>Furthermore, a graph behaves as a dictionary with node id keys linking to node object:</p>
<pre>for id in graph:
    print graph[id].style
</pre>

    <p>To remove nodes and edges you can use the methods below. The <i>graph.clear()</i> method
    removes all nodes and all edges and resets the graph’s layout. This is useful when you want to
    dynamically reload a graph.</p>
<pre>graph.remove_node(id)
</pre>
<pre>graph.remove_edge(id1, id2)
</pre>
<pre>graph.clear()
</pre>

    <p>You can get access to all the nodes connected to a given node from the <i>node.links</i>
    list. This list also has a fast <i>node1.links.edge(node2)</i> method that retrieves the edge
    between two nodes.<br/></p>
    <p> </p>
    <hr size="2" width="100%"/>

    <h2><a id="draw" name="draw" title="draw"></a>Drawing the graph</h2>

    <p>Before we can draw the graph to the canvas, <b>we first need to calculate its layout</b>.
    This may take several seconds or more for graphs with many nodes. More nodes slow down the
    process, as do more visual elements like edge labels. The following methods are involved:</p>
<pre>graph.prune(depth=0)
</pre>
<pre>graph.update(iterations=10)
</pre>
<pre>graph.solve()
</pre>
<pre>graph.draw(weighted=False, directed=False, highlight=[], traffic=None)
</pre>

    <p>The <i>graph.prune()</i> method removes orphaned nodes that have no connections . If
    <i>depth</i> is 1 it removes nodes that have one ore less connections, and so on. Pruning is
    often a good idea, as the less nodes there are in a graph the faster the layout is calculated.</p>
    <p>The <i>graph.update()</i> method calculates a portion the total iterations. This is useful
    in an animation when you want the graph to slowly unfold. When the entire layout has been
    calculated, the <i>graph.done</i> property will be <i>True</i>.</p>
    <p>The <i>graph.solve()</i> method does all the iterations at once. If you’re not running an
    animation you usually use this method before drawing the graph.</p>
    <p>The <i>graph.draw()</i> method draws the graph to the canvas. It will originate from the
    canvas center (although you can nudge it horizontally or vertically with optional <i>dx</i> and
    <i>dy</i> parameters).</p>
    <p> 
    <table>
      <tbody>

          </td><td>The optional <i>traffic</i> parameter can be a number, representing the amount of
          top-trafficked nodes to highlight. Nodes with a high traffic have a lot of shortest paths
          passing through them therefore have a central role in the network.
        </td></tr></tbody></table></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="grey_box">Layout</span></p>
    <p>If you’re using the graph in an animation, you can use the <i>graph.layout.refresh()</i>
    method to trigger some new iterations. This is useful when you are for example dynamically
    adding new nodes after the layout has stopped. The <i>graph.layout.reset()</i> restarts the
    layout from scratch.</p>
<pre>graph.layout.refresh()
</pre>
<pre>graph.layout.reset()
</pre>

    <p>When using the spring-force layout, <i>graph.layout</i> has a <i>tweak()</i> method that
    allows you to play around with the internals of the layout algorithm:</p>
<pre>graph.layout.tweak(k=2, m=0.01, w=15, d=0.5, r=15)
</pre>

    <p>The <i>k</i> parameter is the force constant by which nodes are pushed away from each other,
    <i>m</i> is a dampener for the total attractive/repulsive force, <i>w is</i> a weight
    multiplier (so heavier edges have a bigger attraction), <i>d</i> is the maximum node movement
    per iterations and <i>r</i> is the radius of repulsive force originating from each node.</p>
    <p>You may find the following layout properties easier to use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>graph.layout.force</i>: the attractive/repulsive force in the layout (0.01 by
      default).
      </li><li><i>graph.layout.repulsion</i>: the repulsive radius originating from each node (15 by
      default).
    </li></ul>

    <p>If you are using the circle layout, <i>graph.layout</i> has only one property:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>graph.layout.orbits</i>: the number of circles used in the layout (2 by default).
    </li></ul>

    <h2><a id="style" name="style" title="style"></a>Customizing styles and style rules</h2>

    <p>You can customize the look and feel of the graph down to the bottom. The <i>graph.styles</i>
    dictionary has different <b>styles</b> for different nodes. Each style has some color and font
    properties and a range of methods for drawing each element in the graph. The styles dictionary
    is accompanied by a <i>styleguide</i> containing <b>rules</b> that define how and when to apply
    the styles. You can easily modify existing styles, create new ones, and devise your own rules
    for how to apply them.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="grey_box">Predefined styles</span></p>
    <p>Let’s have a look at the different styles in a graph:

<pre>print graph.styles.keys()
&gt;&gt;&gt; ['default', 'light', 'back', 'marked', 'dark',

    <p>You can change the properties of each of the individual style objects:</p>
<pre>graph.styles.root.fontsize = 20
</pre>

    <p>Or set a property on all styles:</p>
<pre>graph.styles.stroke = color(1)

s.fill = color(1, 0, 0.25, 0.75)
</pre>

    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="grey_box">Style properties</span></p>
    <p>A <i>style</i> object has the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>style.background</i>: graph background <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#color()">color</a> (always picked from the default style).
      </li><li><i>style.fill</i>: fill color for nodes. The default fill is also used as backdrop on
      weighted edges.
      </li><li><i>style.stroke</i>: the stroke color for node outlines. The default stroke is used for
      all edges.
      </li><li><i>style.strokewidth</i>: the width of node outlines and edges.
      </li><li><i>style.text</i>: text color used for node and edge labels.
      </li><li><i>style.font</i>: font used for node and edge labels.
      </li><li><i>style.fontsize</i>: fontsize for node and edge labels.
      </li><li><i>style.textwidth</i>: if the label ’s width exceeds this number it gets wrapped to the
      next line.
      </li><li><i>style.align</i>: aligns the node label either RIGHT or CENTER.<br/>
      </li><li><i>style.depth</i>: True when this style uses the Colors library to render dropshadows.
    </li></ul>

    <p> <span class="grey_box">Styleguide</span></p>
    <p>You can assign the name of a style to <i>node.style</i> and then when the network is drawn
    the node will be visualized using the style’s properties and drawing methods.</p>
    <p>You can assign styles by hand - for example, here’s how to make all nodes with a weight of
    more than 0.6 ‘important’:</p>
<pre>for node in graph.nodes:
    if node.weight &gt; 0.6:
        node.style = "important"
</pre>

    <p>Rules like these (<i>’heavy nodes are important’</i>) can also be bundled in the styleguide
    dictionary:</p>
<pre>graph.styles.guide.append("important", lambda graph, node: node.weight &gt; 0.6)
</pre>

    <p>The default rules in the guide are:</p>
<pre>{ "light"     : lambda graph, node: graph.root in node.links
  "dark"      : lambda graph, node: len(node.links) &gt; 4
  "important" : lambda graph, node: node.weight &gt; 0.75
  "root"      : lambda graph, node: node == graph.root
  "back"      : lambda graph, node: node == graph.events.clicked
}
</pre>

    <ul>
      <li>nodes directly connected to the root get the light-style
      </li><li>nodes with four or more connections get the dark-style
      </li><li>nodes with a weight greater than 0.75 get the important-style
      </li><li>the root node gets the root-style
      </li><li>the node that was last clicked gets the back-style
    </li></ul>

    <p>Below is another interesting rule that keeps clusters of nodes together. The edges of nodes
    that have only one connection become shorter, all others become longer. The default styleguide
    uses a simpler version.<br/></p>
<pre>def cluster(graph, node):
    if node == graph.nodes[0]:
        for e in graph.edges: e.length = 4.0
    if len(node.links) == 1:
        graph.edge(node.id, node.links[0].id).length = 0.2

graph.styles.guide.append("cluster", cluster)
</pre>

    <p>To apply the styling rules to the network:</p>
<pre>graph.styles.apply()
</pre>

    <p>There’s a <i>graph.styles.guide.order</i> property (which is a list of style names) that
    defines the sequence in which style rules will be applied. There’s also a
    <i>graph.styles.clear()</i> method to remove all the rules.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="grey_box">Style drawing methods</span></p>
    <p>A <i>style</i> has customizable drawing methods. We will only go into this briefly here.
    Developers can check the source code in the <i>style.py</i> file in the library. Here’s a quick
    example of how we add our own custom patch for edges:

    <h2><a id="interaction" name="interaction" title="interaction"></a>Interacting with the
    animated graph</h2>

    <p>You can use very small graphs (&lt;100 nodes) in an animation and watch them unfold fluidly.
    The <i>graph</i> object has functionality for mouse interaction as well, bundled in the
    <i>graph.events</i> object. It has the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>graph.events.hovered</i>: <i>None</i> or the node over which the mouse hovers.
      </li><li><i>graph.events.pressed</i>: <i>None</i> or the node on which the mouse is pressing down.
      </li><li><i>graph.events.dragged</i>: <i>None</i> or the node being dragged.<br/>
      </li><li><i>graph.events.clicked</i>: <i>None</i> or the last node clicked.<br/>
      </li><li><i>graph.events.popup</i>: when <i>True</i>, will display a popup window over the hovered
      node.
    </li></ul>

    <p> 
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p><img alt="graph-hover" height="100" src="../etc/lib/graph-hover.jpg" width="150"/></p>
            <p><img alt="graph-drag" height="170" src="../etc/lib/graph-drag.jpg" width="150"/></p>
          </td><td>
            <p>When you hover over a node the <i>graph.events.hover()</i> method fires. It will try
            to display a description of the node’s id from WordNet (if you have the <a href="Linguistics.html">Linguistics</a> or <a href="WordNet.html">WordNet</a> library
            installed). To display your own popup text for a given node, register it in the
            <i>graph.events.popup_text</i> dictionary:</p>
<pre>
graph.events.popup_text["organism"] = "hello"
</pre>
            <p>In an animation you can also simply press down on a node and drag it around to where
            you want it. The graph will stabilize by itself.</p>
            <p>Last but not least, if you click on a node <i>graph.events.click()</i> will fire.
            This method takes one <i>node</i> parameter and does nothing by default, so if you want
            clicking behavior you’ll have to assign your own command:</p>
<pre>
def click(node): print node.id+" clicked"
graph.events.click = click
</pre>

    <h2><a id="connectivity" name="connectivity" title="connectivity"></a>Connectivity</h2>

    <p>Finding out if two nodes are connected (with zero or more other nodes in between them) is
    easy enough with the <i>node.can_reach()</i> method, which returns either <i>True</i> or
    <i>False</i>:<br/></p>
<pre>node.can_reach(node, traversable: lambda node, edge: True)
</pre>

    <p>What is intriguing about this method is the optional <i>traversable</i> parameter. You can
    pass it a custom command. This command takes two parameters, a node and an edge, and returns
    <i>True</i> if the given node is allowed to travel over the given edge.</p>
    <p>This allows for more elaborate searches. For example, in the <a href="Perception.html">Perception</a> library all edges have a type, like <i>is-part-of</i> or
    <i>is-related-to</i>. Traversables are used to check if two nodes are connected using only
    specific types of edges: an oak is a tree only if the oak node can reach the tree node using
    only <i>is-a</i> edges (and not, for example, <i>is-property-of</i>).</p>

    <h2><a id="proximity" name="proximity" title="proximity"></a>Proximity</h2>

    <p>Graphs are not only useful to visualize data, but to analyze it as well. Knowing what the
    shortest path is, how to get from one node to another, can tell us something of how those nodes
    relate to each other.</p>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra’s shortest path
    algorithm</a> is a way to find the closest route from one node to another in the network. For
    example, if the nodes in the network represent cities and their strength represent driving
    distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road, Dijkstra’s algorithm can be used
    to find the shortest route between two cities.</p>
<pre>graph.shortest_path(id1, id2, heuristic=None, directed=False)
</pre>

    <p>The <i>graph.shortest_path()</i> method returns a list of node id’s connecting the two nodes
    with the given id’s. If no connection can be found it will return <i>None</i>.</p>
<pre>path = graph.shortest_path(119, 381)
graph.draw(highlight=path, weighted=True)
print path
&gt;&gt;&gt; [119, 383, 478, 78, 381]
</pre>

    <p><img alt="graph-dijkstra" height="300" src="../etc/lib/graph-dijkstra.jpg" width="550"/></p>
    <p>When searching for a shortest route the <b>edge weight</b> becomes important. Edges with a
    higher weight represent shorter routes. You can think of an edge with a weight of 1.0 as a
    highway and an edge with a weight of 0.0 as a mountain trail. So even if an edge looks longer
    onscreen (because it yields a nicer layout for example) it might still be a better candidate to
    travel by. Likewise, a straight connection may be abandoned in favor of a detour on heavier
    edges.</p>
    <p>Optionally you can also supply your own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">heuristic</a> function to tweak the pathfinder. It is
    a command that takes two node id’s as its parameters and returns a number (usually between -1
    and +1). The lower this number gets the more <i>interesting</i> the connection between the two
    nodes becomes. For example, in a game environment you could use edge weight to represent the
    quality of a road through the world, and supply heuristic terrain penalties for mountains,
    swamps, oceans - to discourage AI-controlled characters from trying to cross the ocean or walk
    through walls to reach an enemy.<br/></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="grey_box">Centrality</span></p>
    <p>How a node is connected to other nodes influences its importance in the network. The Graph
    library uses two measurements to determine a node’s importance: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality">betweenness centrality</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality">eigenvector centrality</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Betweenness centrality</b>: nodes that occur on many shortest paths have a higher
      betweenness. You can think of such nodes as being hubs, landmarks, city centers and so on.
      The betweenness centrality of a node is represented in the <i>node.traffic</i> property as a
      number between 0.0 and 1.0.<br/>
      <br/>
    </li></ul>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Eigenvector centrality</b>: nodes that (indirectly) connect to high-scoring nodes get
      a better score themselves. In this case the edge direction plays an important role. Ideally,
      everyone is pointing at you and you are pointing at no-one - meaning you are at the top of
      hierarchy. The eigenvector centrality is represented in the <i>node.weight</i> property as a
      number between 0.0 and 1.0.
    </li></ul>

            that has three connections that each connect to two other nodes.</p>
            <p>An initial naive estimate would be to say that the node in the first case is more
            important because it has eight connections. However, the node in the second case has
            the <b>potential</b> to influence up to nine other nodes, and therefore it has a higher
            importance in the network.</p>
            <p>The king of a country has only his advisors as direct connections, but his influence

    The graph has two methods that return a list of nodes sorted according to traffic or weight:</p>
<pre>graph.nodes_by_traffic(threshold=0.0)
</pre>
<pre>graph.nodes_by_weight(threshold=0.0)
</pre>

    <p>If you dynamically add new nodes to the graph the balance can shift and you may want to
    recalculate the proximity values:</p>
<pre>graph.betweenness_centrality(directed=False)
</pre>
<pre>graph.eigenvector_centrality(reversed=True, rating={},
                             start=None, iterations=100, tolerance=0.0001)
</pre>

    <p>Both methods recalculate a node’s traffic/weight property and return a dictionary of node
    id’s linked to a value between 0.0 and 1.0. You may also notice the optional <i>rating</i>
    parameter which is a dictionary of node id’s linked to a score to influence it’s weight (e.g.
    Google not only examines a web page’s connections but also its contents - the score of a page’s
    content could be reflected in the <i>ranking</i> dictionary).</p>

    <h2><a id="clustering" name="clustering" title="clustering"></a>Clustering</h2>

    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">Clustering</a> means the
    classification of objects into <b>different groups</b>, so that all the objects in a group
    share some common traits (e.g. a <i>rabbit</i> and a <i>bird</i> both belong to the
    <i>animal</i> group). Clustering is in part related to how you organize your graph, and in part
    to what analysis you can then perform on the graph. The Graph library has some simple tools for
    cluster analysis.</p>
<pre>graph.nodes_by_category(name)
</pre>

    <p>The <i>graph.nodes_by_category()</i> method returns a list of all nodes that have their
    <i>category</i> property equal to the given name.</p>
<pre>graph.fringe(depth=2)
</pre>

    <p>The <i>graph.fringe()</i> method returns a list of nodes on the perimeter of the graph. With
    a <i>depth</i> of 1 it returns all the leaf nodes, with a <i>depth</i> of 2 all the leaf nodes
    and nodes connected to leaf nodes, etc.</p>
<pre>graph.sub(id, distance=1)
</pre>

    <p>The <i>graph.sub()</i> method returns a new <i>graph</i> object that is a subset of the
    given graph. If <i>distance</i> is 0, it will contain only the node with the given <i>id</i>.
    If distance is 1, it will contain the node and all nodes directly connected to that node. If
    <i>distance</i> is 2, it will also contain all nodes that are connected to nodes directly
    connected to the given node, and so on. You can also supply a list of id’s instead of a single
    id.<br/></p>
    <p>Yet another way to create a subgraph is to pass a <b>filtering function</b> instead of an
    id. For example:</p>
<pre>graph =  ximport("graph")
g = graph.create(iterations=500, distance=0.8)

g.add_node("PlotDevice")
g.add_node("Linguistics", category="library")
g.add_node("WordNet", category="library")

g.add_edge("Linguistics", "PlotDevice", label="related-to")
g.add_edge("WordNet", "PlotDevice", label="related-to")
g.add_edge("WordNet", "Linguistics", label="part-of")

# subgraph containing only library nodes:
g = g.sub(lambda node: node.category == "library", distance=0)
g.distance = 1.4
g.solve()
g.draw(directed=True)
</pre><br/>

    <p><img alt="graph-sub" height="150" src="../etc/lib/graph-sub.jpg" width="550"/></p>
    <p><u>Note</u>: remember that if you want to draw a subgraph, you need to recalculate the
    layout with the <i>update()</i> or <i>solve()</i> method.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="grey_box">Subgraph set theory</span></p>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">Set theory</a> deals with union,
    difference and intersection operations between sets of elements. You can compare subgraphs to
    find out which nodes they have in common (<i>intersection</i>), which nodes they do not have in
    common (<i>difference</i>) or which is the combined set of both subgraphs (<i>union</i>).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Union</b>: all elements from A and all elements from B.
      </li><li><b>Difference</b>: elements that appear in A but not in B.
      </li><li><b>Intersection</b>: elements that appear in A as well as in B.
    </li></ul>

    <p>The following methods will return a new subgraph based on set operations:</p>
<pre>graph1.join(graph2)      # union, graph1 | graph2 also works
</pre>
<pre>graph1.subtract(graph2)  # difference, graph1 - graph2 also works
</pre>
<pre>graph1.intersect(graph2) # intersection, graph1 &amp; graphs2 also works
</pre>      

    <p><span class="grey_box">Cliques</span><br/></p>
    <p>In graph theory, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_%28graph_theory%29">clique</a> is a graph in which each
    node is connected to all the other nodes. There’s a <i>graph.is_clique</i> property that
    returns <i>True</i> when the graph is complete. Since each node is connected to every other
    node in a complete graph, its <i>density</i> will be 1.0.</p>
<pre>graph.clique(id, distance=0)
</pre>
<pre>graph.cliques(id, threshold=3, distance=0)
</pre>

    <p>The <i>graph.clique()</i> method returns a subgraph of the biggest clique around the node
    with the given <i>id</i>. It takes an optional <i>distance</i> parameter which will also
    include other nodes connected to the nodes in the clique (see the <i>distance</i> parameter for
    the <i>graph.sub()</i> method).</p>
    <p>The <i>graph.cliques()</i> method returns a list of subgraphs that are cliques of at least
    <i>threshold</i> nodes.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="grey_box">Partitioning</span></p>
    <p>Finally, there’s a powerful technique to split a graph into its <b>unconnected
    subgraphs.</b> Sometimes your graph may contain two or more clusters of nodes without
    connections between them (especially if you don’t know where the data came from). The
    <i>graph.split()</i> method will return a list of unconnected subgraphs, sorted biggest-first:</p>
<pre>subgraphs = graph.split()
subgraphs[0].solve()
subgraphs[0].draw()
