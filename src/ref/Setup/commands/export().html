    <h3>export()</h3>

    <div class="definition">
      <p class="pink_text">The <code>export</code> function is only of use to scripts that are
      using PlotDevice externally via a <code><a href="../tut/Scripting.html#plotdevice.script">from
      plotdevice.script import *</a></code> line. For scripts run within the application, use the
      Export as… commands in the file menu. Exports can also be batched using the <a href="../tut/plotdevice.html"><code>plotdevice</code></a> command.</p>
      <h2>Generating output from external scripts</h2>

      <p>The <code>export</code> function returns a <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement">context
      manager</a> that takes care of canvas-setup and file-generation for both single images and
      animations. By enclosing your drawing code in a <code>with</code> block, you can ensure that
      the correct sequence of <code>clear</code> and <code>save</code> calls are made to the
      <code><a href="#canvas">canvas</a></code> automatically. For instance these two methods of
      generating a png are equivalent:</p>
<pre>from plotdevice.script import *

# export an image
canvas.clear()
... # (do some drawing)
canvas.save('output.png')

# export an image
# (with the context manager clearing and saving the canvas automatically)
with export('output.png') as image:
    ... # (do some drawing)
</pre>

      <h2><a class="anchor" href="#animations" id="animations" name="animations"></a>Animations</h2>

      <p>If you specify a filename ending in <code>mov</code> (or <code>gif</code> if you also pass
      a <code>loop</code> or <code>fps</code> argument), the <code>export</code> context manager
      will return a <code>Movie</code> object. Each time you call its <code>add</code> method, a
      new frame with the contents of the canvas will be added to the end of the animation. Once
      you’ve added the final frame, you must call <code>finish</code> to wait for the video encoder
      thread to complete its work.</p>
      <p>As with the single-image version of the <code>export</code> call, you can use the
      <code>with</code> statement in your code to tidy up some of the frame-drawing boilerplate.
      All three examples are equivalent (note the use of a nested <code>with</code> statement in
      the final example):</p>
<pre># export a 100-frame movie
movie = export('anim.mov', fps=50, bitrate=1.8)
for i in xrange(100):
    canvas.clear() # erase the previous frame from the canvas
    ...            # (do some drawing)
    movie.add()    # add the canvas to the movie
movie.finish()     # wait for i/o to complete

# export a movie (with the context manager closing the file when done)
with export('anim.mov', fps=50, bitrate=1.8) as movie:
    for i in xrange(100):
        canvas.clear() # erase the previous frame from the canvas
        ...            # (do some drawing)
        movie.add()    # add the canvas to the movie

# export a movie
# (with the movie.frame context manager clearing and adding the frame)
with export('anim.mov', fps=50, bitrate=1.8) as movie:
    for i in xrange(100):
        with movie.frame:
            ... # draw the next frame
</pre>

      <h2><a class="anchor" href="#multi-page-pdfs" id="multi-page-pdfs" name="multi-page-pdfs"></a>Multi-page PDFs</h2>

      <p>Creating PDF documents works the same way, letting you either manually <code>clear</code>,
      <code>add</code> and <code>finish</code> the export or take advantage of the
      <code>with</code> statement to hide the repetitive bits. Note that PDF exports use the
      <code>page</code> attribute rather than <code>frame</code>:</p>
<pre># export a five-page pdf document
pdf = export('multipage.pdf')
for i in xrange(5):
    canvas.clear() # erase the previous page's graphics from the canvas
    ...            # (do some drawing)
    pdf.add()      # add the canvas to the pdf as a new page
pdf.finish()       # write the pdf document to disk

# export a pdf document more succinctly
with export('multipage.pdf') as pdf:
    for i in xrange(5):
        with pdf.page:
            ... # draw the next page
</pre>

      <h2><a class="anchor" href="#image-sequences" id="image-sequences" name="image-sequences"></a>Image sequences</h2>

      <p>If you’re generating a series of images, <code>export</code> will automatically give them
      consecutive names derived from the filename you pass as an argument. If the filename is a
      simple <code class="str">’name.ext’</code> string, the sequence number will be appended with
      4 characters of padding (<code class="str">’name-0001.ext’</code>, <code class="str">’name-0002.ext’</code>, etc.). If the filename contains a block of <code>###</code>
      characters, they will be replaced with the sequence number and zero padded to the same width:</p>
<pre># export a sequence of images to output-0001.png, output-0002.png, ...
#                                output-0099.png, output-0100.png
with export('output.png') as image:
    for i in xrange(100):
        with image.sequence:
            ... # draw the next image in the sequence

# export a sequence of images to 01-img.png, 02-img.png, ...
#                                99-img.png, 100-img.png
with export('##-img.png') as image:
    for i in xrange(100):
        with image.sequence:
            ... # draw the next image in the sequence
