<pre>speed(fps)

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <div class="row">
        <p>Using the speed() command causes your script to be interpreted as an animation. In an
        animation, your drawing code does not live in the top-level of the script, but instead is
        factored into a trio of methods defined in the script: <code>setup()</code>,
        <code>draw()</code>, and <code>stop()</code>. The <code>setup</code> method is called once
        at the beginning of a run, and <code>stop</code> is called once the run is halted. The
        <code>draw</code> method is called repeatedly with the canvas being cleared between calls.
        The global variable called <code class="kw">FRAME</code> will be incremented before every
        <code>draw</code> and can be used to track progress.</p>
        <p>The <code>fps</code> argument specifies the maximum speed of the animation in frames per
        second. Note that this is only a maximum and complex animations will likely update less
        frequently.</p>
