    <h1>speed()</h1>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>

    <div class="row">
<pre>speed(fps)
</pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <p>Sets the frame-rate for previewing animations in the application. The <code>fps</code> argument specifies the maximum speed of the animation in frames per second. Note that this is only a maximum and complex animations will likely update less frequently. Calling <i>speed()</i> only makes sense if your script has been written as an <a href="../tut/Animation.html">animation</a>. </p>

      <p>In an animation, your drawing code does not live in the top-level of the script, but instead is factored into a trio of commands that you define yourself: <i>setup()</i>, <i>draw()</i>, and <i>stop()</i>. Your <i>setup()</i> command is called once at the beginning of a run, and <i>stop()</i> is called once the run is halted. The <i>draw()</i> command gets called repeatedly (with the canvas being cleared between calls).</p>

      <p>The global variable called <code class="kw">FRAME</code> will be incremented before every <i>draw()</i> and can be used in your code to track the passage of "time".
