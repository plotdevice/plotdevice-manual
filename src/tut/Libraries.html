    <p>PlotDevice can be extended with a wealth of functionality by importing the right external libraries.
        You can install Python libraries for making HTTP requests, running databases, processing images, and a million other problem-domains you'd never even considered.</p>
        <p>

        These specialized tools aren't included by default for the simple reason that it would make PlotDevice too unwieldy and complex. Instead, PlotDevice's commands apply to the general case and libraries handle the specifics.</p>

    <h2>Python modules</h2>

    <p>Since the scripts you write in PlotDevice use <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, you can access and <b>import</b> any of the <b>modules</b> from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">Standard Library</a> (a.k.a. the "stdlib") in your projects. The stdlib is almost preposterously extensive, reflecting Python's motto of "batteries included". A terrific set of tutorials for some of the most useful modules can be found at <a href="http://pymotw.com/2/contents.html">Python Module of the Week</a>.</p>

    <p>For instance, you can <code>import</code> the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html"><code>json</code></a> module to serialize your data to a string:</p>
    <pre>import json
data = dict(fingers=10, handedness="left", feathers=None)
print(json.dumps(data))
>>> {"handedness": "left", "feathers": null, "fingers": 10}
</pre>

    <p>If you only need certain pieces of functionality from a module, you can import specific functions using the "<code>from … import …</code>" syntax. For example, both of the following snippets make use of the <code>os</code> module's <code>basename</code> function. Use whichever approach makes your code easier to understand:</p>
    <pre>import os
print(os.path.basename("/etc/passwd"))
</pre>
<pre>from os.path import basename
print(basename("/etc/passwd"))</pre>
<pre>>>> passwd</pre>

    <p>You don’t need to install any files or configure anything; PlotDevice knows where the standard libraries are.</p>


    <h2>Libraries from the PlotDevice site</h2>

    <p>The PlotDevice site has a lot of interesting libraries originally developed for <a href="http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Library">NodeBox</a>. Libraries allow you to access <a href="../lib/WordNet.html">natural language</a> processing, or <a href="../lib/Core_Image.html">Core Image</a> filters, or even <a href="../lib/Colors.html">Color</a> math. A list of all libraries is <a href="../manual.html#lib">here</a>.</p>

    <p>To use one of these libraries, you first need to download it to your computer. In most cases, the zip file you download will expand to a folder with the same name as the library. Then, you
    need to place the whole folder (don't mess with its contents) in a known-location where your PlotDevice script can find it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>in the same folder as your PlotDevice script, or</li>
        <li>in the shared folder <code>~/Library/Application Support/PlotDevice</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once the library is installed, you can <code>import</code> it like any other Python module. Here's an example using the WordNet library. Notice how the <i>wordnet</i> folder is in the same directory as the <em>dictscript.pv</em> file (which we just created):</p>
    <p>
        <div class="media"><img height="393" src="../etc/tut/libraries1.png" width="717"/></div></p>

    <p>Now our script can access the library by using the <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/import-confusion.htm"><code>import</code></a> statement along with the library's folder name (note the lack of quotes around the name). When you import a module, a variable with the same name is created and you access its functionality using dot-syntax of the form: <em>module.funcname()</em>. Let's try using the <i>WordNet</i> lib's "glossary" method:</p>

        <div class="media" style="margin:0"><img height="262" src="../etc/tut/libraries2.png" width="534"/></div>
