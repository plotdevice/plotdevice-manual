    <p>The graphics state stores your current color and transformation settings. You could think of
    it as painting. When painting, you can hold one type of brush and put one color of paint on it.
    All the lines you then paint on the canvas have the same color. And the same texture according
    to the thickness and softness of the brush. Naturally, you could paint with both hands and feet
    holding multiple brushes with multiple colors. But then things become chaotic.</p>
    <p>So in PlotDevice you ‘paint’ with one color. All of the elements you draw have the same color,
    until you switch to a different color. Then all subsequent elements you draw have that color.</p>
    <h2>State commands</h2>

    <p>When you run a script, PlotDevice reads the code from <b>top to bottom, like a recipe</b>. When
    it encounters certain commands, it changes the current state. All subsequent elements
    (primitives, paths, text and images) you draw then adhere to the current state.</p>
    <p>Color commands that change the state:<br/>
    <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#colormode()">colormode()</a>, <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#fill()">fill()</a>, <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#stroke()">stroke()</a>, <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#strokewidth()">strokewidth()</a>, <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#nofill()">nofill()</a>, <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#nostroke()">nostroke()</a></p>
    <p>Transformation commands that change the state:<br/>
    <a href="../ref/Transform.html#transform()">transform()</a>, <a href="../ref/Transform.html#translate()">translate()</a>, <a href="../ref/Transform.html#rotate()">rotate()</a>, <a href="../ref/Transform.html#scale()">scale()</a>, <a href="../ref/Transform.html#skew()">skew()</a></p>
    <p>Text commands that change the state:<br/>
    <a href="../ref/Typography.html#font()">font()</a>, <a href="../ref/Typography.html#font()">fontsize()</a></p>
    <p>For example, observe the following script. We start by setting the current fill to red and
    draw three red ovals. Then we set the current stroke to black and change the fill color to
    transparent and draw two ovals with a black outline and a transparent fill:</p>
    <p><img alt="graphics_state1" height="525" src="../etc/tut/graphics_state1.gif" width="588"/><br/></p>
    <p>By default, the current fill color is black. The default strokewidth is 1. However, stroke
    colors won’t show until you define a current stroke color, which is transparent by default.</p>
    <h2>Transformation state</h2>

    <p>You can think of the transformation state along the same lines as when painting. The PlotDevice
    drawing canvas has an <b>origin point</b> at the top left corner (horizontal x=0 and vertical
    y=0). The <a href="../ref/Transform.html#translate()">translate()</a> command lifts up the
    brush and puts it somewhere else. It changes the origin point.</p>
    <p>When you say:</p>
<pre>rect(20, 40, 80, 80)
</pre>

    <p>a rectangle with a width and a height of 80 will be positioned 20 to the right and 40 down
    from the top left corner of the canvas.</p>
    <p>But when you say:</p>
<pre>translate(100, 100)
rect(20, 40, 80, 80)
</pre>

    <p>the origin point is no longer at the top left (x=0 and y=0). We translated it to x=100 and
    y=100. So the rectangle will be drawn 20 to the right and 40 down of the <i>new</i> origin
    point. The rectangle ends up at x=120 and y=140. The translate() command <i>displaces the
    current origin point relative to the previous origin point.</i></p>
    <p><img alt="graphics_state2" height="524" src="../etc/tut/graphics_state2.gif" width="581"/><br/></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Rotation, scaling and skewing work <b>incrementally</b> as well. If you first rotate by 40
    degrees, all the elements you subsequently draw will be rotated by 40 degrees. If you then
    rotate by 30 degrees, the current rotation becomes 70 (40 + 30). All subsequent elements will
    be rotated by 70 degrees.</p>
    <p><img alt="graphics_state3" height="525" src="../etc/tut/graphics_state3.gif" width="588"/></p>
    <p>Likewise, if you keep putting <span class="inline_code">scale(0.8)</span> in your script the
    elements on the canvas become smaller and smaller. The second time you scale, the current scale
    becomes 0.64 (0.8 x 0.8), the third time it becomes 0.512 (0.64 x 0.8) and so on.</p>
    <h2>Corner mode transformations</h2>

    <p>We haven’t discussed the <a href="../ref/Transform.html#transform()">transform()</a> command
    yet. As you may have already read in the reference you can switch it between CENTER and CORNER.
    Centered transformation means that all shapes, paths, text and images rotate scale and skew
    around their own center. As we would probably expect them to. Corner mode transformations means
    that elements <b>transform around the current origin point</b>. This can be a difficult concept
    to grasp.</p>
    <p>Take a look at stars and planets. The sun is a star in space and our Earth orbits around it.
    You could think of the sun as the current origin point on the canvas (remember that this is not
    necessarily the top left) and the Earth as an oval that is rotating around it using a corner
    mode transform.</p>
    <p>In the example below, we move the origin point to x=100 and y=100 and have three pieces of
    text rotate around it. Without the corner mode transform, they would rotate around their own
    center and it would be a lot more difficult to position them.<br/></p>
    <p><img alt="graphics_state4" height="520" src="../etc/tut/graphics_state4.gif" width="581"/></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The <a href="../ref/Transform.html#reset()">reset()</a> command will reset all
    transformations from that point onward in your script.</p>
    <h2>State in a state?</h2>

    <p>The transform() command can also be used as part of a <code class="kw">with</code> block,
    allowing you to create a state in a state. Inside of the block, all subsequent translate(),
    rotate(), scale() and skew() commands are valid only until the end of the block. Then the
    transformation state reverts to how things where before the <code>transform()</code>. This way
    you can <b>transform groups of elements that need to stay together</b>.</p>
    <p>Color and text commands are not included in this resetting behavior.<br/></p>
    <p>Here’s a short example. Note that the last rectangle isn’t rotated. That’s because the
    rotation happens within the transform() block.</p>
<pre>rect(20, 20, 40, 40)
with transform():
    rotate(45)
    rect(120, 20, 40, 40)
rect(220, 20, 40, 40)
</pre>

    <p>Using a solar-system anaolgy, each transform() block is a bit like a moon orbiting around a
    planet. Each planet is orbiting around a certain origin point (the sun), but regardless of
    where this is, the moon is always orbiting around the planet. A planet is a local origin point
    for the moon.</p>

<pre>size(450, 450)

def draw():
    
    stroke(0)
    transform(CORNER)
    
    # This is the starting origin point,
    # where we place the sun.
    translate(225, 225)
    oval(-5, -5, 10, 10)
    text("sun", 10, 0)
    
    for i in range(3):
        
        # Each planet acts as a local origin for the orbitting moon.
        # Comment out the transform() statement and see what happens.
        with transform():
        
            # This is a line with a length of 120,
            # that starts at the sun and has an angle of i * 120.
            rotate(FRAME+i*120)
            line(0, 0, 120, 0)
            
            # Move the origin to the end of the line.
            translate(120, 0)
            oval(-5, -5, 10, 10)
            text("planet", 10, 0)
            
            # Keep rotating around the local planet.
            rotate(FRAME*6)
            line(0, 0, 30, 0)
            text("moon", 32, 0)
        
        # The origin moves back to the sun outside of the block.
</pre>  

    <h2>Breaking the state</h2>

    <p>If necessary, you can break away from the state and colorize and transform elements
    individually. Each of the primitive commands (line(), rect(), oval(), star(), arrow()),
    beginpath(), drawpath() and text() have three optional parameters: <i>fill</i>, <i>stroke</i>
    and <i>strokewidth</i>.</p>
    <p>So you could do:</p>
<pre>rect(20, 20, 100, 100, fill=(1, 0, 0))
</pre>

    <p>which is the same as</p>
<pre>r = rect(20, 20, 100, 100)
r.fill = color(1, 0, 0)
</pre>

    <p>and instantly draws a red rectangle regardless of the current state fill color.</p>
    <p>Likewise you could also:</p>
<pre>r.translate(x, y=None)
r.rotate(degrees=0, radians=0)
r.scale(x, y=None)
r.skew(x, y=None)
</pre>

    <p>The transformations are then applied only to rectangle r.</p>
    <p>With the text() command you can also use the state-less <i>font</i> and <i>fontsize</i>
    parameters:</p>
<pre>text("hello", 20, 20, font="Helvetica")
</pre>
