    <h1>Getting started using PlotDevice</h1>

    <p>The first thing you want to do once you’ve <a href="Download">downloaded</a> the application
    is run some example scrips. There’s a folder with tons of sample code which can be accessed from the app's <span class="message">Examples</span> menu. Select one of them and
    press <span class="message">⌘R</span> to see it run (if the script is an animation, you can bring it to a halt by pressing <span class="message">⌘.</span>). Then try changing some numbers in the script and run it again to see
    what happens.
    </p>

    <h2>Reference</h2>
    <p>Then you will want to have a look at the <a href="../manual.html">reference</a> to see what
    scripting commands are available. When you use a command you plug in <b>parameters</b> that
    define its behavior. For example, the reference may mention something like:</p>
<pre>rect(x, y, width, height)
</pre>

    <p>This means that <span class="inline_code">rect</span> is a command with <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,
    <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> parameters. The name of the command tells something about what
    it is going to do (<i>rect</i> will probably draw a rectangle on the screen). The parameters
    you replace with values of your own. For example:</p>
<pre>rect(40, 80, 100, 50)
</pre>

    <p>This will draw a rectangle located 40 from the left edge of the canvas, 80 from the top of
    the canvas, with a width of 100 and a height of 50. Go through the reference and try out each
    command to get a general idea of what is possible. PlotDevice has commands to draw primitive
    shapes (rectangles, ovals), create your own shapes with Bézier paths, transform shapes
    (translate, rotate, scale, etc.), and work with image files and text.
    </p>
    <h2>Random loops</h2>
    <p>To create a lot of rectangles at random positions, we use a <a href="Repetition.html">for-loop</a> and the <a href="../ref/Utility.html#random()">random()</a>
    command. Both of these are essential concepts in PlotDevice. With a loop you can repeat actions
    several times (up to hundreds of thousands of times). With randomness you can add subtle
    variation to your script.</p>
    <p>Commands ‘inside’ the loop are indented with the TAB-key. In this case we draw five
    rectangles at a random position:</p>
<pre>for i in range(5):
    rect(random(50), random(200), 20, 20)
</pre>

    <h2>Tutorial</h2>
    <p>The tutorial contains essential tips on how commands work and how to write scripts.
    We recommend starting out as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Environment.html">Environment</a>: the basics about the PlotDevice application.
      </li><li><a href="Primitives.html">Primitives</a>: more information about command parameters.
      </li><li><a href="Repetition.html">Repetition</a>: more information about loops.
      </li><li><a href="Variables.html">Variables</a>: instead of plugging numbers directly into a
      command, you can also store them in a <i>variable</i> and then use the variable throughout
      your script.
      </li><li><a href="Collections.html">Lists</a>: lists are variables that contain more than a single
      number. They can contain all sorts of things. If you really want to get your hands dirty a
      good comprehension of lists is essential.
      </li><li><a href="Graphics_State.html">Graphics state</a>: how primitives are rotated and
      transformed. This tutorial may be a little bit hard to grasp at first, but very useful
      nonetheless.
    </li></ul>

    <p>At one point you’ll also discover how to work with <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#bezier()">Bézier paths</a>. This is where PlotDevice truly shines. All of
    the things you can do with paths are unlocked in the <a href="Paths.html">tutorial on
    paths</a>.</p>

    <h2>PlotDevice is Python</h2>

    <p>The programming language that drives PlotDevice is <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>,
    written by Guido Van Rossum. Python emphasizes productivity and code readability. We think
    it’s excellent choice for those just learning to program. You can find all the documentation and tutorials at <a href="http://python.org/doc/">python.org</a>.</p>
    <p>We usually keep these under our pillow:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information about for-loops, if-statements, def-commands: <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node6.html">http://docs.python.org/tut/node6.html</a>
      </li><li>Interesting things you can do with Python lists:<br/>
      <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html">http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html</a>
      </li><li>Interesting things you can do with Python strings:<br/>
      <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/string-methods.html">http://docs.python.org/lib/string-methods.html</a>
    </li></ul>

    <p>Python code in itself is very readable. It is part of your responsibility to keep it that
    way. You may want to share your scripts, and you may want to modify or expand it in a few
    months. A well-written script can last a lifetime – it’s not something you generate output from
    and then throw away.</p>
    <p>Steps to keep your code clean and readable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Comment your code</b>: add comments that describe (in English) the purpose of the code
      below.
      </li><li><b>Blocks of code</b> that peform a single action are kept together.
      </li><li><b>Reuse code</b>: if a block of code is needed multiple times in a script, make a
      command out of it.
      </li><li><b>Good variable names</b> are essential. A variable may appear throughout a script so
      pick a good name for it, something that explains what value is contained in the variable.
    </li></ul><br/>



    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#using-plotdevice-as-a-module" id="using-plotdevice-as-a-module" name="using-plotdevice-as-a-module"></a>Using PlotDevice as a module in other scripts</h3>

    <p>Though the <a href="plotdevice.html"><code>plotdevice</code></a> command provides a convenient way
    to launch scripts with the PlotDevice interpreter, you may prefer to use the graphics context and
    export functions from within your own module (and running whichever <code>python</code> binary
    your system or virtualenv provides).</p>
    <p>Detailed installation instructions can be found in the project’s <code><a href="https://github.com/samizdatco/plotdevice-pyobjc/blob/master/README.md">README</a></code> file. To
    simplify the use of PlotDevice with other external libraries, we recommend installing the module
    into a <a href="http://virtualenv.org">virtualenv</a> along with your other dependencies:</p>
    <pre class="shell"><span class="kw">$ </span>virtualenv env
<span class="kw">$ </span>source ./env/bin/activate
<span class="o">(</span>env<span class="o">)</span><span class="kw">$ </span>pip install plotdevice
<span class="o">(</span>env<span class="o">)</span><span class="kw">$ </span>pip install requests envoy bs4 <span class="grey"># some other useful packages</span>
</pre>

    <h2><a href="#plotdevice-star" id="plotdevice-star" name="plotdevice-star"></a>Initializing a graphics context from your script</h2>

    <p>The <code>plotdevice</code> module initializes your script’s namespace with one
    identical to a script running with the app or command line tool. For instance, the following
    will draw a few boxes:</p>
    <pre class="shell"><span class="grey">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>
<span class="kw">from</span> <span class="nn">plotdevice</span> <span class="kw">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>
<span class="kw">for</span> <span class="kw">x</span><span class="s">,</span> <span class="kw">y</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="kw">grid</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="s">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="s">,</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="s">,</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="s">):</span>
    <span class="kw">rect</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="kw">x</span><span class="s">,</span><span class="kw">y</span><span class="s">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="s">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="s">)</span>
</pre>

    <p>You can then generate output files using the global <code>canvas</code> object. Its
    <code>save</code> method takes a file path as an argument and the format will be determined by
    the file extension (<code>pdf</code>, <code>eps</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>jpg</code>,
    <code>gif</code>, or <code>tiff</code>):</p>
<pre>canvas.save('~/Pictures/output.pdf')
</pre>

    <p>If you’re generating multiple images, be sure to reset the graphics state in between frames:</p>
<pre>canvas.clear()
</pre>

    <p>But if you plan to do more than generate a one-off, you’ll likely find the <a href="../ref/Canvas.html#export()"><code>export()</code></a> function more convenient. It provides
    convenience methods for writing images, vector documents, and even animations.</p>
