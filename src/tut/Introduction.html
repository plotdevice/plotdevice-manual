    <span class="big_text">It’s hard to imagine a 21st century visual culture without computer
    graphics, think of Photoshop, Flash, the web, games: computer graphics have rapidly and
    steadily developed to a level at which people can express themselves creatively and share
    content with amazingly less and less prior expertise. The last decade has also seen the
    interesting emergence of generative art and computational design.</span><br/>

    <h2>What is generative art?</h2>

    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art">Generative art</a> refers to art that
    has been generated, composed, or constructed in an algorithmic manner through the use of
    systems defined by computer software algorithms, or similar mathematical or mechanical or
    randomized autonomous processes. Although the term is not necessarily limited to any kind of
    programming language of computer system, it has known a considerable rise in use since the
    development of <i>Processing.</i></p>
    <p><a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> is an open source project initiated in 2001
    by Casey Reas and Benjamin Fry, former students of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda">John Maeda</a> at the MIT Media Lab. John Maeda
    pioneered in computer graphics by bringing animation and interaction to the web - eventually
    leading to the rise of popular tools such as Macromedia’s Flash and Director. Processing uses
    the Java programming language to create visual output. Processing was the first to standardize
    the concept of an <i>electronic sketchbook</i>, as a tool to get non-programmers started with
    programming through the instant gratification of visual feedback.</p>
    <h2>What is computational design?</h2>

    <p>Computational design is the discipline of applying computational approaches to design
    problems. This term is more common in the architectural and scientific fields. It involves the
    development of algorithms for composition rules, shape arithmetic, symmetry, visual grammar,
    design methodology, etc. A tool like Processing can be used to create generative art, while the
    development of the tool itself is a computational design challenge.<br/></p>

    <h2>Advantages to an algorithmic approach</h2>

    <p>There are many advantages in using code to generate graphics. Most notably:<br/>
    <br/></p>
    <p><span class="orange_box">Workflow automation</span></p>
    <p>Any design process or workflow has a creative side and a production side. We want to focus
    on the creative side as much as possible. The production side (including tasks such as
    generating alternatives on a theme, applying style guides across different pages and media,
    certifying PDF documents for printing, executing corrections based on consumer-feedback) we
    would often rather leave up to someone else. Algorithms can be a formidable production partner
    here.</p>
    <p>When Just Van Rossum and Erik Van Blokland of LettError developed <a href="http://drawbot.com">DrawBot</a> in 2002 they described production advantages in terms of
    <i>volume</i>, <i>complexity</i> and <i>alternatives</i>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Volume</b>: many assignments call for a volume that is unrealistic to create in a
      short time. When you have large volumes, automating the process is something that just comes
      naturally, or out of laziness. The computer can work a lot faster than we can when creating 1
      500 pages.<br/>
    </li></ul>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Complexity</b>: using templates, style sheets and automated layout engines, we can let
      the computer do complex layouts for us. By adjusting a single layout algorithm, we adjust the
      complete layout across pages, without having manually to reorder every element.<br/>
    </li></ul>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Alternatives</b>: if we don’t have to manually adjust every element to see if a
      different layout might work too, we can try out many alternatives. This is a form of digital
      sketching: since the production stage is automated, you can readjust the layout or your
      concept up to the last minute.<br/>
      <br/>
    </li></ul>

    <p><span class="orange_box">Creative leverage</span></p>
    <p>Traditional graphics software has the advantage of robustness. It has been carefully
    developed and optimized by experts over the course of many years. It often has the disadvantage
    of lacking simplicity. User applications that focus on one specific problem (either pixels,
    vectors, page layout, web pages or animation) force us to think in segments. User interfaces
    composed of predefined menus, buttons and sliders limit our creativity to what others have
    preprogrammed for us.</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://research.nodebox.net">research on PlotDevice</a> initiated in 2005 defines
    creative advantages in terms of <i>integration</i>, <i>language</i> and <i>recombination</i>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Integration</b>: by relinquishing <i>many</i> user-friendly interfaces and focusing on
      <i>one</i> programming language we can freely address any of a computer’s possibilities. We
      can combine many different techniques in the same environment.
    </li></ul>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Language</b>: it is easier to express creative ideas and processes with language than
      with mouse gestures. We can store the language description as a recipe to reuse and
      manipulate - something we cannot easily do with a mouse gestures.<br/>
    </li></ul>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Recombination</b>: once we have enough recipes we can bundle these in a package that
      solves a design problem (like <a href="../lib/Colors.html">finding good colors</a>). We can
      continuously derive new functionality and recombine it with other recipes, like playing with
      Lego-blocks.<br/>
      <br/>
    </li></ul>

    <p><span class="orange_box">Community</span><br/></p>
    <p>Generative/computational graphics software is commonly developed in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> context, meaning <b>it is free and
    anyone can contribute to it</b>. You can learn by getting help from the online community,
    benefit from the programming code of others, and in turn acquire more experience and confidence
    which you can pass on to newcomers. Acknowledgment is traded for tutoring. For example,
    technical experts will code new features on request. In return they can benefit from spreading
    their code and learning how artistic experts use it to create productive and aesthetically
    pleasing results. The more people join in, the better the software gets.</p>
    <p>Marius Watz has been curating <a href="http://www.generatorx.no">Generator.x</a> since 2005,
    the related website is a tremendous effort in monitoring the evolution in different generative
    art communities.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <hr size="2" width="100%"/>

    <h2>Emergent in nature</h2>

    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">Emergence</a> refers to the way complex
    systems and patterns arise out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions. Emergent
    patterns occur throughout nature: cells forming organisms, organisms forming societies (an ant
    colony for example), the weather. The global behavior that arises is complex to analyze, but on
    the contrary the local intelligence of one <i>agent</i> (cell, ant) is fairly basic.</p>
    <p>Emergence is an integrated part of generative art. You write short pieces of programming
    code and put them together to observe how they interact visually. You may not always know what
    is going to show up until you press ‘Run’. This requires a different design approach to what
    you may be used to.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Control</b>: we cannot control every single detail in a complex composition with 100
      000 elements. Rather, we will have to think about <b>the system</b> as a whole.
    </li></ul>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Build from bottom-up</b>: coming up with an idea and then working out the details is a
      <i>top-down</i> approach. Because it is difficult to control every single detail, it is
      difficult to adhere to a top-down approach. To keep things fun when learning how to program
      it is better to adopt a <i>bottom-up</i> strategy. Start out simple with a few commands you
      know, put them in a loop, add some randomness and see what happens. Keep it simple. Expand
      your ideas and slowly add new programming code as you learn more.
    </li></ul><br/>

    <p><i>Two compositions by <b>Veronika Schmidt</b> that illustrate the concept of emergence and
    the power of generative art. Although the resulting compositions are complex and intricate, the
    actual process is elementary. Three or four images that Veronika created are imported in
    PlotDevice. Then, thousands of copies of them are placed on top of each other in decreasing angles
    and scales.</i></p>

    <h2>Research, reuse, refer</h2>

    <p>In a bottom-up approach, what do we define as ‘the bottom’? Behind the facade of a simple
    programming command, thousands of lines of code may hide. A newcomer’s base may be someone
    else’s top. In this process we create standards instead of personal opinions, ideas and
    concepts.</p>
    <p>Suppose you want to visualize something <i>dynamic</i>. You can easily use and adapt
    <a href="../lib/Boids.html">a flocking algorithm</a> instead of struggling with your own
    experiments from scratch. Flocking algorithms have been around for a long time, have been
    published, discussed, standardized. They are <i>dynamic</i> in their own nature. They look
    great. People will be intrigued into why and how you used them, look at your work with new
    eyes, grow a scientific interest in bird flocks. The alternative may be a lengthy, subjective
    or even pointless discussion on your personal notions of the word <i>dynamic</i>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Methodology</b>: a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology">methodology</a>
      is a set of procedures and assumptions that underlie a particular study. In the above example
      the methodology is ‘to examine and apply bird flocking as a visualization of the concept
      <i>dynamic</i>’. A methodology may explain a researcher’s ontology.
    </li></ul>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Ontology</b>: an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28computer_science%29">ontology</a> is an objective
      model or scheme representing the concepts in a domain and the relationships between them,
      bottom-up. It is used to reason about the objects in that domain.
    </li></ul>

    <p>The objective approach of having a method and a model has useful advantages. Instead of
    defining what you <i>want as a result</i>, you define what you <i>need to get started</i>. It
    enables you to start out small, subdividing the problem into workable portions. Your results
    have an objective basis so others can tune in, expand or reuse them. You can reuse the
    knowledge attained in other domains.</p>
    <p>On a final note, don’t be a purist. There is nothing wrong with finalizing your generated
    artwork by hand. To improve the aesthetical quality you can use the features in traditional
    graphics software to chip away unwanted portions, adjust colors, add typography, ... It needs
    to look good.</p>

    <h2>Getting started using PlotDevice</h2>

    <p>The first thing you want to do once you’ve <a href="Download">downloaded</a> the application
    is run some example scrips. There’s a folder with tons of examples. Open them in PlotDevice and
    press APPLE-R to run them. Then try changing some numbers in the script and run it again to see
    what happens.<br/>
    <br/></p>
    <p><span class="orange_box">Reference</span></p>
    <p>Then you will want to have a look at the <a href="../manual.html">reference</a> to see what
    scripting commands are available. When you use a command you plug in <b>parameters</b> that
    define its behavior. For example, the reference may mention something like:</p>
<pre>
<span class="kw">rect</span><span class="s">(</span>x, y, width, height<span class="s">)</span>
</pre>

    <p>This means that <span class="inline_code">rect</span> is a command with <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,
    <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> parameters. The name of the command tells something about what
    it is going to do (<i>rect</i> will probably draw a rectangle on the screen). The parameters
    you replace with values of your own. For example:</p>
<pre>
<span class="kw">rect</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">40</span>, <span class="s">80</span>, <span class="s">100</span>, <span class="s">50</span><span class="s">)</span>
</pre>

    <p>This will draw a rectangle located 40 from the left edge of the canvas, 80 from the top of
    the canvas, with a width of 100 and a height of 50. Go through the reference and try out each
    command to get a general idea of what is possible. PlotDevice has commands to draw primitive
    shapes (rectangles, ovals), create your own shapes with Bézier paths, transform shapes
    (translate, rotate, scale, etc.), and work with image files and text.<br/>
    <br/></p>
    <p><span class="orange_box">Random loops</span></p>
    <p>To create a lot of rectangles at random positions, we use a <a href="Repetition.html">for-loop</a> and the <a href="../ref/Utility.html#random()">random()</a>
    command. Both of these are essential concepts in PlotDevice. With a loop you can repeat actions
    several times (up to hundreds of thousands of times). With randomness you can add subtle
    variation to your script.</p>
    <p>Commands ‘inside’ the loop are indented with the TAB-key. In this case we draw five
    rectangles at a random position:</p>
<pre>
<span class="kw">for</span> i <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="s">range</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">5</span><span class="s">)</span>:
    <span class="kw">rect</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="kw">random</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">50</span><span class="s">)</span>, <span class="kw">random</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">200</span><span class="s">)</span>, <span class="s">20</span>, <span class="s">20</span><span class="s">)</span>
</pre> 

    <p><span class="orange_box">Tutorial</span></p>
    <p>The tutorial contains essential tips on how commands work and how to write scripts.<br/>
    We recommend starting out as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Environment.html">Environment</a>: the basics about the PlotDevice application.
      </li><li><a href="Primitives.html">Primitives</a>: more information about command parameters.
      </li><li><a href="Repetition.html">Repetition</a>: more information about loops.<br/>
      </li><li><a href="Variables.html">Variables</a>: instead of plugging numbers directly into a
      command, you can also store them in a <i>variable</i> and then use the variable throughout
      your script.<br/>
      </li><li><a href="Lists.html">Lists</a>: lists are variables that contain more than a single
      number. They can contain all sorts of things. If you really want to get your hands dirty a
      good comprehension of lists is essential.
      </li><li><a href="Graphics_State.html">Graphics state</a>: how primitives are rotated and
      transformed. This tutorial may be a little bit hard to grasp at first, but very useful
      nonetheless.<br/>
    </li></ul>

    <p>At one point you’ll also discover how to work with <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#beginpath()">Bézier paths</a>. This is where PlotDevice truly shines. All of
    the things you can do with paths are unlocked in the <a href="Paths.html">tutorial on
    paths</a>.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <hr size="2" width="100%"/>

    <h2>Clean, commented code</h2>

    <p>The programming language that drives PlotDevice is <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>,
    written by Guido Van Rossum. Python emphasizes on productivity and code readability. We think
    it’s excellent to learn programming. You can find all the documentation and tutorials on
    <a href="http://python.org/doc/">http://python.org/doc/</a>.</p>
    <p>We usually keep these under our pillow:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information about for-loops, if-statements, def-commands: <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node6.html">http://docs.python.org/tut/node6.html</a>
      </li><li>Interesting things you can do with Python lists:<br/>
      <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html">http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html</a>
      </li><li>Interesting things you can do with Python strings:<br/>
      <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/string-methods.html">http://docs.python.org/lib/string-methods.html</a>
    </li></ul>

    <p>Python code in itself is very readable. It is part of your responsibility to keep it that
    way. You may want to share your scripts, and you may want to modify or expand it in a few
    months. A well-written script can last a lifetime - it’s not something you generate output from
    and then throw away.</p>
    <p>Steps to keep your code clean and readable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Comment your code</b>: add comments that describe (in English) the purpose of the code
      below.
      </li><li><b>Blocks of code</b> that peform a single action are kept together.
      </li><li><b>Reuse code</b>: if a block of code is needed multiple times in a script, make a
      command out of it.
      </li><li><b>Good variable names</b> are essential. A variable may appear throughout a script so
      pick a good name for it, something that explains what value is contained in the variable.
    </li></ul>
