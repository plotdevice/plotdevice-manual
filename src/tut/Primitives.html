    <p>PlotDevice provides a set of commands for drawing basic geometric shapes, text, and images. All of these <a href="../ref/Primitives.html">drawing primitives</a> take a pair of x/y coordinates to set the position. But based on the command-type this will be interpreted as either the top-left corner location or the "origin" point. You'll find yourself using both kinds of positioning depending on what you're trying to accomplish.</p>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p>In the <a href="../ref/Primitives.html">Reference</a>, each drawing primitive and its usage is discussed thoroughly. The reference is something you’ll want to keep close by when you start learning PlotDevice. After a bit of experimenting you’ll know all the primitives by heart.</p>

    <p>For example, take a look at documentation for the <a href="../ref/Primitives.html#rect()">rect()</a> command. As you might expect, this command draws a rectangle. At the top of the reference entry is a description of its <em>syntax</em>. The list of required and optional arguments provides the details you need to invoke the command in a way that PlotDevice understands.</p>

    <p>In case of the rect() command the syntax is:</p>
<pre>rect(x, y, width, height, roundness=0.0, plot=True)
</pre>

    <p>All commands in PlotDevice look like this: you have the <strong>name</strong> of the command
    (<em>rect</em> for example) which gives you a hint of what the command will do, and some stuff
    between parentheses. The stuff between "parens" will be referred to as
    <strong>parameters</strong> or <strong>arguments</strong> interchangeably.</p>

    <h2>Parameters</h2>

    <p>Now <em>rectangle</em> could mean a lot of things. Imagine a rectangle with an equal width
    and height, this would be a square. We could have a <em>square()</em> command in PlotDevice.
    Imagine you would like a small rectangle at the bottom of the canvas ... we could have a
    <em>smallbottomrect()</em> command ... we could define an infinite number of commands for
    rectangles in all sizes and flavors!</p>

    <p>Instead of defining a tangle of commands, there is a single <i>rect()</i> command with <em>parameters</em>. Parameters are values you can customize to change the command's behavior. You can supply numbers, <a href="Variables.html">variables</a>, <a href="Strings.html">strings</a>, or even objects as parameters depending on what the command knows how to handle.</p>
    <p>For example, to draw a square in the top left of the canvas:</p>
<pre>rect(0, 0, 40, 40)
</pre>

    <p>Notice how we replaced the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> from
    the syntax description with real numbers. These number parameters describe how our rectangle
    will look: it is positioned in the top left (x is 0 and y is 0) and has an equal width and
    height of 40.
    <span class="media" style="margin-left:-50px;"><img alt="" height="311" src="../etc/tut/primitives1.png" width="658"/> </p>

    <h2>Optional parameters</h2>

    <p>You’ll notice some other parameters in the <i>rect()</i> syntax which we didn’t define, the
    <em>roundness=0.0</em> for example. If a parameter description has an <em>=something</em> next
    to it, this means it is optional. If we don’t define this parameter in our script, it’s default
    value is <em>something</em>. In case of the rectangle command, the corner roundness is 0 by
    default, unless we explicitly say:</p>
<pre>rect(0, 0, 40, 40, roundness=0.5)
</pre>

    <p>Now we have a rectangle with 50% round corners:
        <span class="media" style="margin-left:-50px;"><img alt="" height="311" src="../etc/tut/primitives2.png" width="658"/> </p>


    <h2>The "<code>plot</code>" parameter</h2>

    <p>All of the primitives have an optional argument called <code>plot</code> that defaults to <code class="kw">True</code>. This is a hint that just by calling the command you'll be adding a new shape to the canvas. In general this is exactly what you intended, but there are certain special cases where you'll want to store a not-yet-drawn primitive in a <a href="Variables.html">variable</a> for use later on.</p>

    <p>You can accomplish this by calling the command with an optional argument of <code>plot=<span class="kw">False</span></code>. When you're ready to add the primitive to the canvas, call the <a href="../ref/Canvas.html#plot()">plot()</a> command with the reference you saved as its sole parameter:</p>
    <pre>square = rect(50,50, 100,100, plot=False) # don't draw yet
... # do other things
plot(square) # add the square to the canvas</pre>

    <h2>Defining your own shape-drawing commands</h2>

    <p>It’s not that difficult to create your own commands in PlotDevice. In the <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a> tutorial you’ll learn how to create a function that combines calls to the basic shapes to create more-complicated graphics. Also look at the tutorial on <a href="Bezier_Paths.html">Béziers</a> to see how you can draw freeform shapes of your choosing.</p>
