    <p><a href="Variables.html">Variables</a> can hold entire lists of data. Lists are essential
    when your scripts increase in complexity: they are a way to group bits and pieces of
    information that belong together, for example: all the words to draw on screen, all the
    possible colors from which the script can choose, all the fonts from which the script can
    choose.</p>
    <p>A list in PlotDevice is no different from a list in real life: it can hold a summary of stuff
    to do, groceries to buy, a sheet of names and adressess. The main difference is that in real
    life, we usually start counting from one, while lists in programming <strong>start from
    zero</strong>.</p>
    <p>The first element in a list has index zero, the second element in a list has index one.</p>
    <p><span class="media"><img alt="" height="250" src="../etc/tut/lists-groceries.jpg" width="500"/></span></p>
    <h2>Creating a list</h2>

    <p>So, what does the code look like? Below is the grocery list defined in PlotDevice. The list is
    defined between <strong>square brackets</strong>. Each item in the list is a piece of text (a
    string), therefore they are embedded in quotes. The list is assigned to a variable named
    <em>groceries</em>, but we know that variables can have any name we like, so it could be named
    <em>g</em> or <em>stufftodo</em> as well for that matter.</p>
<pre>groceries = ["apples", "pears", "carrots", "cucumber", "yoghurt", "milk"]
print len(groceries)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6
</pre>

    <p>A list can contain any kind of data: strings, numbers, and even lists.<br/>
    The len(<em>list</em>) command returns the number of items in a list.</p>
    <h2>Retrieving and editing items in a list</h2>

    <p>You can reference items in a list directly, by adding the index of the item you want to the
    variable name, between square brackets:</p>
<pre>print groceries[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; apples
</pre>
<pre>groceries[3] = "banana"
print groceries
&gt;&gt;&gt; ["apples", "pears", "carrots", "banana", "yoghurt", "milk"]
</pre>

    <p>Don’t forget: items in a list start with index zero. That’s why in the above example the
    fourth element is replaced. The fourth element has index 3.</p>
    <h2>Adding items to the list</h2>

    <p>Data in a list can change over the course of time. New items can be added to it, or old
    items deleted from it, just like you can add stuff to buy to a grocery sticky-note, or scratch
    out things.</p>
    <table border="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img alt="" height="247" src="../etc/tut/lists-append.jpg" width="247"/>
          </td><td>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            To append an item to the end of the list:
<pre>
groceries.append("eggs")
print groceries
&gt;&gt;&gt; ["apples", "pears", 
&gt;&gt;&gt;  "carrots", "banana", 
&gt;&gt;&gt;  "yoghurt", "milk",
&gt;&gt;&gt;  "eggs"]
</pre>To remove the eggs from the list:
<pre>
del groceries[6]
</pre>
          </td></tr></tbody></table>

    <p>Items can be inserted halfway the list with the <em>list</em>.insert(<em>i</em>,
    <em>item</em>) command, where the <em>i</em> parameter is the position where you want the
    element to be.</p>
    <h2>Looping through the list</h2>

    <p><em>Looping through a list</em> is the same as going to the mall and working off your
    grocery list top to bottom: the first item to collect are <em>apples</em>, once you have those,
    you need to fetch <em>pears</em>, and so on.</p>
    <p>Going through all the items in a list is one of the most essential things you do when
    working with data. You could retrieve the items in a list manually when there are only a few of
    them, but not when the list contains hundreds or even thousands of, for example, strings of
    text that you want to draw to the screen.</p>
    <table border="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img alt="" height="244" src="../etc/tut/lists-loop.jpg" width="245"/>
          </td><td>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Using the for-loop:
<pre>
for item in groceries:
    print "buy some " + item 
&gt;&gt;&gt; buy some apples 
&gt;&gt;&gt; buy some pears 
&gt;&gt;&gt; buy some carrots 
&gt;&gt;&gt; buy some banana 
&gt;&gt;&gt; buy some yoghurt 
&gt;&gt;&gt; buy some milk 
&gt;&gt;&gt; buy some eggs
</pre>
          </td></tr></tbody></table>

    <p>In the above example, the indented command(s) below the <em>for</em> command are executed
    for each item in the list. The <em>item</em> variable consecutively contains each item in the
    list. After that, the loop ends.</p>
    <h2>Random items from the list</h2>

    <p>You can let the code decide on its own which items to draw from the list by using the
    <a href="../ref/Utility.html#choice()">choice()</a> command.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>

    <p>This is a very braindead example of how you would use small lists to generate compositions.
    The script has a list of words it can use, and a list of colors it can use. After that, the
    script is free to act on its own: it takes random words and colors from the two lists and draws
    them to the screen in random sizes and rotations. It retains a certain coherence between
    different runs because of its limited words and colors.</p>

    <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/lists-loop9.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/lists-loop10.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/lists-loop11.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/lists-loop12.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/lists-loop13.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/lists-loop14.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/lists-loop15.jpg" width="132"/></span>
    <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/lists-loop16.jpg" width="132"/></span></p>
    <p>The code:</p>
<pre>words = ["Lists", "are", "fun"]
colors = [color(1,0,0), color(1,1,1), color(0,0,0)]
 
for i in range(40):
 
    x = random(WIDTH)
    y = random(HEIGHT)
    rotate(random(360))
    fontsize(random(10,100))
 
    fill(choice(colors))
    text(choice(words), x, y)
</pre>

    <h2>Dictionaries</h2>

    <p>Dictionaries are extremely useful kinds of lists that have string indices, <em>keys</em>,
    that you define yourself. Each key is unique and references an item in the list. Dictionaries
    are created with <strong>curly braces</strong> instead of square brackets.</p>
<pre>heading = {}
heading["font"] = "ConduitITC-Medium"
heading["size"] = 18
heading["fill"] = color(1,0,0)
 
print heading.keys()
&gt;&gt;&gt; ["font", "fill", "size"]
 
print heading["size"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 18
 
if heading.has_key("fill"): print "found!"
&gt;&gt;&gt; found!
</pre>

    <h2>More on lists</h2>

    <p>There is a lot more stuff you can do with lists, like sorting and reversing, or writing
    filter functions for lists. The full documentation is <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007100000000000000000">here</a>, in the Python
    documentation.</p>
