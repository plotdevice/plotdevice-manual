    <p>PlotDevice is designed to output PDF documents, images, and movies. In general it makes the trade-off of  output quality over realtime responsiveness. If you're looking to make something with low-latency interactivity (or other general whizzy-ness) you’re probably better off with a tool like <a href="http://www.cityinabottle.org/nodebox/">NodeBox for OpenGL</a> or <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>
    <p>However, if you do want to experiment with interactivity in PlotDevice, there’s some built-in
    support that might be of help to you. This assumes you already know how to make an <a href="Animation.html">animation</a> in PlotDevice.<br/></p>
    <h2>Interacting with the mouse</h2>

    <p>In a PlotDevice animation, there are three predefined variables that store the current position
    of the mouse cursor and the state of the mouse button:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code class="kw">MOUSEX</code>: the horizontal location of the mouse cursor
      </li><li><code class="kw">MOUSEY</code>: the vertical location of the mouse cursor
      </li><li><code class="kw">mousedown</code>: is True when the mouse button is pressed, False otherwise
    </li></ul>

    <p>You would typically use the <code class="kw">mousedown</code> variable in an if-statement:</p>
<pre>if mousedown:
     # do stuff when the mouse is pressed
else:
     # do stuff when the mouse isn't pressed
</pre>

    <h2>Interacting with the keyboard</h2>

    <p>Three predefined variables store the keys a user is pressing during a PlotDevice animation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code class="kw">key</code>: the last key pressed
      </li><li><code class="kw">keycode</code>: the integer keycode of the last key pressed
      </li><li><code class="kw">keydown</code>: is True when a key is being pressed, False otherwise
    </li></ul>

    <p>The <code class="kw">key</code> and <code class="kw">keycode</code> variables are updated as long as any key is being pressed.</p>
    <p><code class="kw">KEY_UP</code>, <code class="kw">KEY_DOWN</code>, <code class="kw">KEY_LEFT</code>, <code class="kw">KEY_RIGHT</code> contain the keycodes for the arrow keys and the delete key is represented by <code class="kw">KEY_BACKSPACE</code>.<br/></p>
    <h2>Example</h2>

    <p>A fun example is this little sketch application. It builds up a list of points you've clicked-and-dragged over then draws a smooth bezier path connecting the vertices at every frame.</p>
<pre>size(400 ,400)
speed(30)

def setup(anim):
    anim.path = []

def draw(anim):
    nofill()
    stroke(0)

    if mousedown:
        pt = Point(MOUSEX, MOUSEY)
        anim.path.append(pt)

    if anim.path:
        bezier(anim.path, smooth=True)
</pre>
