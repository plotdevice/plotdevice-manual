    <p>PlotDevice is a Mac OS X application in which you can write Python scripts that produce visual output. You can save the generated graphic as a PDF, an image, or a Quicktime/GIF <a href="Animation.html">animation</a>. Each script opened in PlotDevice has a separate window divided into three parts.<br>
    <span class="media" style="margin-left:-50px;"><img alt="" height="621" src="../etc/tut/environment1.png" width="659"/></span>
    </p>

    <h2>Code, output, and messages</h2>

    <p>The three parts are for code, output, and messages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The <strong>code</strong> you write goes in the top right area. Any keywords are
        automatically colored (for example, all of the PlotDevice commands in <a href="../manual.html">the reference</a>).</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>Once you have a script going, you can press <span class="message">⌘R</span> to have PlotDevice examine
        your script and generate visual <strong>output</strong>, in the left area. Don’t hesitate
        to press <span class="message">⌘R</span> as often as you like, seeing what output your script produces is
        the best way to learn what it does.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>The lower right area is for <strong>messages</strong>: remarks that PlotDevice has about
        any errors in your script, or any output from the <em>print</em> command. PlotDevice isn’t
        very bright when it comes to analysing your code – it’s a computer program, and only
        recognises commands and statements when they are written in exactly the right way (or
        <em>syntax</em>).</p>
      </li></ul>

    <p>Errors in scripts are common, and you will encounter a lot of them at first. Errors are an
    unavoidable part of the programmatic design process. Don’t let them discourage you – instead,
    find out what is going wrong in your script so you won’t make the same mistake next time.</p>

    <h2>Interrupt a running script</h2>

    <p>Sometimes a running script takes a long time to render it’s output. You can then stop
    PlotDevice by pressing <span class="message">⌘.</span>. PlotDevice will still render the partially finished output.</p>

    <h2>Exporting</h2>

    <p>Once you are satisfied with the output of your script, you can export it to one or more
    PDF’s or images: press <span class="message">⌘P</span> (or choose Export to Image from the File menu). Here
    you can select the number of pages you want to export. Each page results in a separate PDF or
    image document. For each page, PlotDevice reruns the script – this is especially useful if your
    script contains <a href="../ref/Misc.html#random()">random()</a> commands, since the output
    will then be different for each page.<br/>

    </p>

    <p>A multiple-page export of this example script generates random output. This is an important
    part of the PlotDevice-philosophy: you define the general <em>style</em> of the output in your
    script, while having the option to retain a range of freedom in which choices are left up to
    PlotDevice. In this way, you can quickly develop a consistent style that looks different each
    time, quickly test and asses your creations.</p>
    <p>A different composition of ovals could be used on each page, with the same ease as creating
    only a single page:</p>
    <p><span class="media"><img alt="" height="548" src="../etc/tut/environment-balls.png" width="542"/></span></p>

    <p>
    PDF documents can be opened in Adobe Illustrator (for example), where you can ungroup the
    composition and transform and scale the individual elements without loss of quality.</p>
    <h2>Saving</h2>

    <p>When you save your work, you save the script, not the output. In fact, you save the
    <em>recipe</em> or template style. You can open your script again later on, make changes, or
    apply it to different shapes or images for example. The script is a piece of your
    way-of-working stored on disk. Moreover, the script takes much less space on disk than the
    actual output.</p>
    <h2>The coordinate system</h2>

    <p>When you place an element on the canvas, you define its positions in terms of <em>x</em> and
    <em>y</em> coordinates. The <em>x</em> is the horizontal position measured from the left of the
    canvas, the <em>y</em> the vertical position measured from the top.</p>
    <p>PlotDevice has an inverted coordinate system which might be confusing to DrawBot users. In a Cartesian coordinate system
    going ‘down’ would mean that <em>y</em> becomes negative, while in PlotDevice <em>y</em>
    gets bigger. I think this keeps things comprehensible when creating page layouts; because pages
    work from top to bottom as well.<br/>
