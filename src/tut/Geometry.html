    <p>More often than not, your PlotDevice scripts will involve at least a bit of mathematics.
    Things like fluid motion, orbital behavior, and easing-in and -out all require a little number-crunching. But fear not, this chapter collects some of the more-useful math tools for dealing with 2D drawing.</p>


    <h1>Transformation State</h1>

    <p>When you draw primitives to the PlotDevice canvas, their position is specified relative to the "origin" in the upper left corner. By changing the "transformation state", you can modifiy the location of the origin point which will affect how all subsequent pairs of coordinates are translated into canvas positions.</p>

    <p>Perhaps it's easiest to think of transformation state in terms of a real-world pen &amp; paper analogy. When you move the pen to a pair of coordinates, your arm moves a relative distance from its starting point. When you change transformation state, you're picking up the pen and shifting the paper before making the same arm movements as before.</p>

    <h2>Basic transformations</h2>

    <p>To get a sense of how transformations interact with drawing commands, let's look at the <a href="../ref/Transform.html#translate()">translate()</a> command. It allows you to shift the canvas horizontally and vertically (but without changing its orientation or size). For instance, when you say:</p>
    <pre>rect(20, 40, 80, 80)</pre>
    <p>a rectangle with a width and a height of 80 will be positioned 20 to the right and 40 down from the top left corner of the canvas. We'll refer to its coordinates as (20,40) for short.</p>

    <p>But when you say:</p>
<pre>translate(100, 100)
rect(20, 40, 80, 80)
</pre>

    <p>the origin point is no longer at the top left (0,0) since we translated it to (100,100). As a result, the <i>rect()</i> created in the second line will be drawn 20 to the right and 40 down of from the <b>new</b> origin point. Thus the rectangle's final resting place will be (120,140).</p>

    <p>The <i>translate()</i> command shifts the origin relative to the <b>current</b> origin point. Note how calling it repeatedly causes the rectangle – drawn at (20,40) in each instance – to be positioned further and further to the lower right:</i>
    <div class="media"><img alt="" height="482" src="../etc/tut/graphics_state2.png" width="666"/></div>
</p>
    <p>The <a href="../ref/Transform.html#rotate()">rotate()</a>, <a href="../ref/Transform.html#scale()">scale()</a>, and <a href="../ref/Transform.html#skew()">skew()</a> commands also work <b>incrementally</b> based on the "current" transformation state. If you first rotate by 40&deg;, all the elements you subsequently draw will be rotated by 40&deg;. If you then
    rotate by 30&deg;, the current rotation becomes the sum of the two rotations: 40&deg;+30&deg; = 70&deg;.
    <div class="media"><img alt="" height="445" src="../etc/tut/graphics_state3.png" width="656"/></div>
</p>


    <p>Likewise, if you keep calling <code>scale(0.8)</code> in your script the
    elements on the canvas become smaller and smaller. The second time you call it, the current scale
    becomes 0.64 (0.8 &times; 0.8), the third time it becomes 0.512 (0.64 &times; 0.8), and so on.</p>

    <p>The <a href="../ref/Transform.html#reset()">reset()</a> command undoes any transformation changes from earlier in the script and repositions the origin at the canvas's top left corner.</p>


    <h2>Corner mode transformations</h2>

    <p>We haven’t discussed the <a href="../ref/Transform.html#transform()">transform()</a> command
    yet. As you may have already read in the reference you can switch it between two "modes": <code class="kw">CENTER</code> and <code class="kw">CORNER</code>.
    Centered transformation means that all shapes, paths, text and images will rotate, scale, and skew
    around <b>their own center</b> (as we would probably expect them to). Using corner-mode transformations means
    that elements transform around the <b>current origin point</b>. This can be a difficult concept
    to grasp.</p>

    <p>In the example below, we move the origin point to (100,100) and have three pieces of
    text rotate around it. Without the corner mode transform, they would rotate around their own
    center and it would be a lot more difficult to position them. Since the corner mode rotation is relative to the origin, we can draw each piece of text at the same relative coordinates (15, 0):</p>
    <div class="media"><img alt="" height="427" src="../etc/tut/graphics_state4.png" width="656"/></div>


    <h1>Nested State</h1>

    <p>In addition to allowing you to change the mode, the <i>transform()</i> command has special "clean up" behavior when used as part of a <code class="kw">with</code> block. It allows you to safely create state-in-a-state.</p>

    <p>Inside the indentated block, any <i>translate()</i>,
    <i>rotate()</i>, <i>scale()</i> and <i>skew()</i> commands are valid only until the end of the block. Then the
    transformation state reverts to how things were prior to the with-statement. This way
    you can transform groups of elements that need to stay together.</p>

    <p>Here’s a short example. Notice that the last rectangle isn’t rotated? That’s because the <i>rotate()</i> call happens within the <i>transform()</i> block and is reset after drawing the second rectangle.</p>

    <div class="example">
        <span><img src="../etc/tut/graphics_state7.png"></span>
        <pre>rect(20, 20, 40, 40)
with transform():
    rotate(45)
    rect(120, 20, 40, 40)
rect(220, 20, 40, 40)
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>You can think of these nested states as analogous to the orbits of planets and moons in our solar system. The planets orbit a central origin point, the Sun, while the moons orbit around their respective planets. You can think of a <i>transform()</i> block as a shift in perspective – you're setting a new "local" origin point centered not on the Sun but on a particular planet. The planet's moons orbit this new, local origin (wherever this is), blissfully unaware of the massive star at the center of it all.</p>

            # that starts at the sun and has an angle of i * 120.

      <a id="Point-Geometry" name="Point-Geometry"></a>
      <h1>Point Geometry</h1>

      <p>PlotDevice scripts are rife with x/y coordinate pairs. You use coordinates to place primitives on the canvas, add line segments to a <a href="Bezier_Paths.html">Bezier</a>, and so forth. Most of the time you can choose these locations through intuition or trial and error. But occasionally you'll want to perform calculations on points to assemble your compositions in a <em>relative</em> manner.</p>

      <p>Sometimes you'll be working with a pair of points and want to know the angle or distance between them. In other cases you may have a single point and need to calculate a second position relative to the first. To aid in these kinds of tasks, PlotDevice provides a simple class called <a href="../ref/Misc.html#Point">Point</a>. </p>


      <h2>Point Objects</h2>
      <p>You can create a <i>Point</i> by passing a pair of coordinate values to the constructor function and access its coordinates through the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> attributes.</p>
      <pre>pt = Point(13,37)
print pt.y
>>> 37</pre>
      <p>You can unpack it back into a pair of values through simple assignment:</p>
      <pre>x, y = pt
print x, y
>>> 13 37</pre>

      <p><i>Point</i> objects support basic arithmetic operators (as does the similar <a href="../ref/Misc.html#Size">Size</a> object):</p>
      <pre>
pt = Point(10, 20)
print pt * 2        # Point(20, 40)
print pt / 2        # Point(5, 10)
print pt + 5        # Point(15, 25)
print pt + (40, 30) # Point(50, 50)
</pre>
<pre>
pt = Point(10, 20)
sz = Size(200,200)
print pt + sz       # Point(210, 220)
print pt + sz/2     # Point(110, 120)
</pre>



      <h2>Drawing with computed points</h2>

      <p>Once you have a <i>Point</i>, you can "ask" it all sorts of questions about how it relates to other points with a few useful (and speed-optimized) <a href="../ref/Misc.html#Point-methods">math methods</a>. You can pull off some neat graphical tricks by combining the <i>Point</i> methods in your scripts.</p>

      <p>Finding the angle from a central origin to a randomly positioned point:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img src="../etc/tut/math-angle.png" width="194" height="194"/></span>
        <pre>
r = 2.0
origin = Point(WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2)

for i in range(5):
    pt = Point(random(WIDTH), random(HEIGHT))
    arc(pt, r)

    a = origin.angle(pt)
    with transform(CORNER):
        translate(origin.x, origin.y)
        rotate(-a)
        arrow(30, 0, 10)
</pre>
      </div>


      <p>Orbiting around an origin point:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img src="../etc/tut/math-coordinates.png" width="194" height="194"/></span>
        <pre>
r = 2.0
origin = Point(WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2)
arc(origin, r) # a.k.a. arc(origin.x, origin.y, r)

for i in range(10):
    a = 36*i
    pt = origin.coordinates(85, a)
    arc(pt, r)
    line(origin, pt)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Drawing perpendicular lines around a circular path:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img src="../etc/tut/math-perpendicular.png" width="194" height="194"/></span>
        <pre>
stroke(0.5) and nofill()
path = oval(45, 45, 105, 105)
for t in range(50):
    curve = path.point(t/50.0)
    a = curve.angle(curve.ctrl2)
    with transform(CORNER):
        translate(curve.x, curve.y)
        rotate(-a+90) # rotate by 90°
        line(0, 0, 35, 0)
</pre>
      </div>





    <h2>Angle measurements</h2>
    <p>As you may remember from trigonometry, there are two commonly used systems for expressing the size of angles. In day-to-day life we're most likely to encounter ‘degrees’ ranging from 0 to 360. In mathematics it's more traditional to use ‘radians’ ranging from 0 to 2<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-style:italic;">&pi;</span>. PlotDevice recognizes that different situations may call for different angle units and provides some utilities to make switching between them easy.</p>

    <p>A number of commands take an angle as one of the arguments. By default, you're expected to use degrees. But by calling the <a href="../ref/Canvas.html#geometry()">geometry()</a> command with <code class="kw">DEGREES</code>, <code class="kw">RADIANS</code>, or <code class="kw">PERCENT</code> you can switch between modes on the fly.</p>

    <p>Any subsequent call to a drawing or transformation command that deals with angles will then deal in the newly-specified units. The <i>angle()</i> and <i>coordinates()</i> methods discussed above also obey the <i>geometry()</i> setting – both for interpreting arguments and providing return values.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <span><img src="../etc/tut/math-angles.png"></span>
      <pre>
with stroke(0), nofill():
    arc(50,25, 25, range=180)

    geometry(RADIANS)
    arc(50,75, 25, range=pi)

    geometry(PERCENT)
    arc(50,125, 25, range=.5)
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>To make working with radians more convenient, PlotDevice provides a pair of global constants – <code class="kw">pi</code> and <code class="kw">tau</code> – representing a half- and full-circle respectively.
      </p>






    <a id="Sequences" name="Sequences"></a>
      <h1>Rational Proportions</h1>

      <p>Sometimes you want to set the position or size of objects in such a way that they
      interrelate to each other, creating a kind of "harmony" between them. For example, sine
      waves are great for coordinating motion since they ease in and out.</p>

      <p>Another interesting proportional principle is the so-called <i>golden ratio</i> or "3-5-8 rule". It has been around in aesthetics for millennia, though its longevity seems to have as much to do with <a href="http://vimeo.com/88132964">groupthink</a> as anything "fundamental" about the proportion.</p>
      <p>For our purposes, the great thing about it is that it can be expressed as a mathematical series – the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci sequence</a>.</p>
<pre>def fib(n):
    if n == 0: return 0
    if n == 1: return 1
    if n &gt;= 2: return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

def goldenratio(n, f=4):
    # Returns two proportional numbers whose sum is n.
    f = max(1, min(f, 10))
    n /= float(fib(f+2))
    return n*fib(f+1), n*fib(f)
</pre> 

      <p>Colored rectangles proportioned with the golden ratio:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img height="242" src="../etc/tut/math-fib1.png" width="242"/></span>
        <pre>
w1, w2 = goldenratio(260)
h1, h2 = goldenratio(260)
b1, b2 = goldenratio(1.0)
b3, b4 = goldenratio(b1)

fill(0, b1/2, b1)
rect(0, 0, w1, h1)

w, h = 260, 260

th = h # top height
bh = 0 # bottom height
for i in range(10):
    th, bh = goldenratio(th)
    v = float(th)/w + 0.3
    fill(0, v/2, v)

    y += th
    th = bh

      <h1>Trigonometry Fundamentals</h1>

      <p>A sine calculates the vertical distance between two points based on the angle. A cosine calculates the horizontal distance.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <span><img height="260" src="../etc/tut/math-trig1.jpg" width="260"/></span>
          <p>Let’s say we have two points, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, connected by a line.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img height="260" src="../etc/tut/math-trig2.jpg" width="260"/></span>
          <p>Now let’s assume <em>a</em> is at the origin (or center) of a circle. The circle
          has a radius equal to the length of the line connecting <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>.</p>
          <p>So <em>b</em> is located somewhere on the circle’s circumference.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img height="260" src="../etc/tut/math-trig3.jpg" width="260"/></span>
          <p>There is a horizontal and vertical distance between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>.</p>
          <p>We can use <em>sine</em> and <em>cosine</em> to determine those distances.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img height="260" src="../etc/tut/math-trig4.jpg" width="260"/></span>
          <p>Each line from <em>a</em> to a point on the circle’s circumference (for example,
          <em>b</em>) has an angle.</p>
          <p>Measured counterclockwise, starting from 0°, a circle has a total circumference of
          360°. So a line from <em>a</em> going straight up would have an angle of 90°.</p>
          <p>In the case of the line between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, the angle is 60°.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img height="260" src="../etc/tut/math-trig5.jpg" width="260"/></span>
          <p>The cosine function calculates the <strong>horizontal</strong> distance between
          <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> based on the angle.</p>
          <p>The sine function calculates the <strong>vertical</strong> distance between
          <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>.</p>
          <p>In the case of an angle of 60°, the sine yields 0.5. So the horizontal distance
          between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> is half the length of the line between <em>a</em>
          and <em>b</em>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img height="260" src="../etc/tut/math-trig6.jpg" width="260"/></span>
        <div>
          <p>With sine and cosine we can calculate the distance between <em>a</em> and
          <em>b</em>.</p>
          <p>This is useful if we have position coordinates for <em>a</em> and we need to
          calculate the position of a point <em>b</em> that is orbiting around it.</p>
          <p>For 60°, the sine yields 0.5, meaning half the length of the distance between
          <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. So the horizontal distance between <em>a</em> and
          <em>b</em> is 70 &times; 0.5 or 35.</p>
          <p>So <em>b</em>’s x equals <em>a</em>’s x plus 35.<br/></p>

        <span><img height="260" src="../etc/tut/math-trig7.jpg" width="260"/></span>
          <p>The command in PlotDevice would look like this:</p>
<pre>
def coordinates(x0, y0, distance, angle):
    from math import radians, sin, cos
    angle = radians(angle)
    x1 = x0 + cos(angle) * distance
