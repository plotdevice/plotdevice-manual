    <p>Paths in PlotDevice are made up of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%e9zier_curve">Bezier
    curves</a>. Bezier curves are commonly applied in computer graphics to draw curves. A Bezier
    curve is defined by a starting point, an ending point, and two <i>control handles</i> that
    describe those points’ vector. The first handle describes the forward curvature of the starting
    point, the second handle the backward curvature of the second point.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
<pre>with bezier(100, 100, fill=None, stroke=0, close=False) as path:
    curveto(150, 100, 200, 200, 50, 400)
</pre>

    <p>Draws the following curve:</p>
    <p><br/>
    <span class="media"><img height="552" src="../etc/tut/paths-bezier.jpg" width="552"/></span><br/>
    <br/>
    The path will be filled and closed by default, without a stroke color.<br/>
    We use <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#nofill()">nofill()</a>, <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#autoclosepath()">autoclosepath()</a> and <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#stroke()">stroke()</a> to get a plain visualization.<br/></p>
    <h2>Bezier math in PlotDevice</h2>

    <p>In PlotDevice, you have access to all the points on a path and to all of their control handles.
    This way, you can transform paths on the fly, and even manipulate type as well (using the
    <a href="../ref/Typography.html#textpath()">textpath()</a> comand). Additionally, you can
    perform a number of math operations on paths (for example finding out what the x and y
    coordinate would be of a point halfway down the path) and unite or intersect different
    paths.<a id="Manipulating_Paths" name="Manipulating_Paths"></a></p>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Manipulating Paths</h3>

      <p>Each of the PlotDevice shape commands (<a href="../ref/Primitives.html#oval()">oval()</a>,
      <a href="../ref/Primitives.html#rect()">rect()</a>, etc.) returns a path. This path is
      actually <b>a list of points</b>, in which each point (or <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#Curve">Curve</a>) has certain properties that you can
      manipulate. This way you can retrieve or edit the coordinates for each point, the coordinates
      of its control handles, and the kind of points you are dealing with (straight line, curve,
      pen move).</p>

            <td><img src="../etc/tut/paths-transform1.jpg"/><br/>
            <br/>
            This is the path and its points returned from the textpath() command, for the character
            <i>e</i> in the Dolly typeface:

            <br/>
            This is the same path, but modified. The location of each point in the path is
            translated downwards.

            </td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Looping through all the points</h2>

      <p>As the above example shows, you can easily manipulate a path by looping through all of the
      points in the path with a <a href="Repetition.html">for-loop</a>, before actually drawing the
      path.</p>
<pre>path = textpath("hello", 100, 100)
points = []
for point in path:
  # --&gt; Manipulate points here
  points.append(point)
bezier(points)
</pre>
<pre>with bezier(100, 100, plot=False) as path:
  curveto(150, 100, 200, 200, 50, 400)

points = []
for point in path:
  # --&gt; Manipulate points here
  points.append(point)
bezier(points)
</pre>

      <h2>Manipulating points</h2>

      <p>Each point in the path is a <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#Curve">Curve</a>
      object with the following attributes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>point.x</i>: the x-coordinate or horizontal location.
        </li><li><i>point.y</i>: the y-coordinate or vertical location.<br/>
        </li><li><i>point.cmd</i>: the type of line segment, either <code class="kw">LINETO</code>,
        <code class="kw">CURVETO</code>, <code class="kw">MOVETO</code> or <code class="kw">CLOSE</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If <code>point.cmd</code> is <code class="kw">CURVETO</code>, a pair of
      ‘control handles’ will also be defined:</p>
    <ul>
        </li><li><i>point.ctrl1.x</i>: the x-coordinate of the first control handle of the curve.<br/>
        </li><li><i>point.ctrl1.y</i>: the y-coordinate of the first control handle of the curve.<br/>
        </li><li><i>point.ctrl2.x</i>: the x-coordinate of the second control handle.
        </li><li><i>point.ctrl2.y</i>: the y-coordinate of the second control handle.
      </li></ul>

      <p>The handles are useful for paths that consist of multiple Bezier curves. The <i>ctrl1</i>
      handle of a point controls how the curve connects to the previous point, the <i>ctrl2</i>
      handle how the curve connects to the next point.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
<pre>with bezier(100,100, fill=None, stroke=1, close=False) as path:
    curveto(150, 100, 200, 200, 150, 200)
    curveto(100, 200, 200, 350, 300, 300)
print path[1].ctrl1.x
</pre>

      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="media"><img height="256" src="../etc/tut/paths-ctrl1.jpg" width="341"/></span></p>
      <h2>Example</h2>

      <p>The following example manipulates a text path, letting each curving point <i>droop</i> a
      bit (let’s hope the guys at Underware don’t freak when they see what happened their beautiful
      typeface)! Some more advanced math could create a handwritten variation of the text, or a
      text in which character looks different each time.</p>

      <span class="media"><img height="87" src="../etc/tut/paths-broken.jpg" width="334"/></span><br/>
      <br/></p>
<pre>font("Dolly-Bold", 100)
path = textpath("broken", 200, 200)

points = []
for point in path:

    if point.cmd == CURVETO:
        point.ctrl2.x += 5
        point.ctrl2.y -= 10
        point.y += 5
    points.append(point)

      <h3>Path Mathematics</h3>

      <p>Paths in PlotDevice consist of Bezier curves. Each curve has a starting point and an ending
      point, and control handles. But what if we want to know the location of a point on the path
      that is not one of these, but somewhere in between? What is the location of <b>halfway the a
      curve</b> for example? A <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#BezierPath">path</a> in PlotDevice has
      some interesting methods we can use:</p>
<pre>path.points(amount=100)
</pre>
<pre>path.point(t)
</pre>
<pre>path.addpoint(t)
</pre>

      <p>The <i>path.points()</i> method returns a list containing <i>amount</i> points along the
      path. In the same way the <i>path.point()</i> method returns a single point at <i>t</i>,
      which is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the time on the path. The
      <i>path.addpoint()</i> inserts a new point at <i>t</i> on the path.</p>
      <p>A path also has the following properties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>path.length</i>: returns the total length of the path.
        </li><li><i>path.contours</i>: a list of separate contours in the path (these are paths as
        well).<br/>
      </li></ul>

      <p>These speed-optimized commands are extremely useful when calculating orbits of animated
      elements moving down an invisible path in an animation, when creating custom type like the
      <a href="LetterKnitter.html">LetterKnitter</a>, when <a href="Superfolia">growing grass</a>
      on shapes, and so on and so on.</p>
      <p>A special thanks goes to professor F. De Smedt at the Free University of Brussels for his
      integration and interpolation algorithms (also check the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casteljau%27s_algorithm">de Casteljau’s algorithm</a>).<br/></p>

      <h2>Finding points on a path</h2>

      <p>The example above is an illustration of how points on a path can be found with <i>t</i> (a
      number between 0.0 and 1.0), which represents time on the path. When <i>t</i> is 0.5, this
      means halfway the path. 0.0 is the origin of the path, 1.0 the end.</p>
      <p>The code:</p>
<pre>with bezier(100, 100, fill=None, stroke=0, close=False) as path:
    curveto(150, 100, 200, 150, 150, 200)
    curveto(50, 250, 200, 350, 400, 400)

for t in range(11):
    pt = path.point(0.1*t)
    oval(pt.x-2, pt.y-2, 4, 4)
</pre>

      <p>And it’s even easier like this:</p>
<pre>for pt in path.points(11):
    oval(pt.x-2, pt.y-2, 4, 4)
</pre>

      <p>It’s easy to create <b>path filters</b> this way (in analogy to image filters). Here are
      some good <a href="Path_Filters.html">examples</a>.<br/></p>
      <h2>Inserting points on a path</h2>

      <p>Injecting new points in the path is equally easy:</p>
<pre>nofill()
with bezier(100, 500, stroke=0.5, close=False) as path:
    curveto(200,250, 600,600, 400,300)

path.addpoint(0.25)
stroke(0.2)
for point in path:
    oval(point.x-4, point.y-4, 8, 8)
</pre>

      <p><img alt="pathmatics-split" src="../etc/tut/pathmatics-split.jpg"/><br/></p>
      <h2>Contours in a path</h2>

      <p>A path is basically made up of <b>segments</b>: two points and the curve in between. A
      group of segments that has a beginning and an ending, or is closed, is a <b>contour</b>.
      Character glyphs are a composite of contours (for example: the inner and outer oval of the
      character ‘o’ are two contours). In typography it’s often useful to get the separate
      contours.</p>
<pre>fontsize(50)
path = textpath("contours", 10, 100)
for contour in path.contours:
    bezier(contour, stroke=random(0.5), fill=None)
</pre>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Compound paths</h3>

      <p>Paths in PlotDevice support so-called <i>boolean</i> operations. This means you can create a
      new c<b>ompound path from a combination of other paths</b>. This is useful if you want to
      create a shape from a combination of other shapes (like ovals and rectangles) and then
      flatten the group into a single path. Manipulating a single shape is much easier and faster
      than manipulating a group of shapes.</p>
<pre>path1.union(path2, flatness=0.6)
</pre>
<pre>path1.intersect(path2, flatness=0.6)
</pre>
<pre>path1.difference(path2, flatness=0.6)
</pre>

      <p>Each of the three methods returns a new <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#BezierPath">path</a>
      combined from the two given paths. The way in which the new path is traced differs for each
      method, as you can observe below:</p>

            </td></tr></tbody></table>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The returned path can be manipulated like any other path in PlotDevice, you can <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#fill()">fill()</a> and <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#stroke()">stroke()</a> it, <a href="../ref/Transform.html#rotate()">rotate()</a> it and put it (or multiple copies of it)
      onscreen with <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#bezier()">bezier()</a>.</p>
      <p>One thing to note is that the compound path will not contain any curves, rather, it is
      made up of numerous straight line segments (we say that the path is <b>flattened</b>)<i>.</i>
      Each of the compound methods has an optional <i>flatness</i> parameter. The lower it gets,
      the more line segments will be drawn (and hence the smoother the resulting shape).</p>
      <h2>Flattening stack</h2>

      <p>With a for-loop we can keep adding new paths to the compound path. In the example below,
      we create a number of circles varying in size, and append them to one flattened compound
      path:</p>
<pre>compound = None
for i in range(50):
    r = random(75)
    path = oval(random(300), random(200), r, r, plot=False)
    if not compound:
        compound = path
    compound = compound.union(path)
bezier(compound, fill=None, stroke=0)
</pre> 

      <p><img alt="paths-compound4" src="../etc/tut/paths-compound4.jpg"/></p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2>Using a Transform object</h2>

      <p>It’s easy enough to draw transformed and colored copies of the compound path, but what if
      we want to <b>rotate and scale the individual shapes</b> before flattening them? We can use
      the <a href="../ref/Transform.html#Transform">Transform</a> object in PlotDevice for this
      purpose.</p>
<pre># We construct our indivual shape in the top-left corner.
# This is where corner-mode transforms originate.
# We'll later on place the eventual compound path
# where we want it with translate().
path = rect(-10, 0, 20, 100, plot=False)

# Let's chip away small piece of the rectangle:
path = path.difference(rect(-15, 80, 20, 15, plot=False))

# Create a rotation transform we'll repeatedly apply to a path
t = Transform()
t.rotate(20)

compound = path
for i in range(17):
    # Before adding the rectangle shape to
    # the flattened compound, we rotate it a bit.
    path = t.apply(path)
    compound = compound.union(path)

translate(275, 275)

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Clamping paths</h3>

      <p>Paths in PlotDevice can be <b>forced to fit</b> a bounding box. Then as the size of the box
      is adjusted the path will stretch accordingly. This reverse logic is useful in some
      situations where a path needs to exactly fit an area and we don’t want to be bothered with
      creating the shape in exactly the right proportions or at the right position.</p>
<pre>path.fit(x=None, y=None, width=None, height=None, stretch=False)
</pre>

      <p>All of the parameters are optional so you can define any combination of them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>x</i>: the path will be positioned at the specified x value.
        </li><li><i>y</i>: the path will be positioned at the specified y value.
        </li><li><i>width</i>: the path will be of the specified width.
        </li><li><i>height</i>: the path will be of the specified height.
