      <p>Paths in PlotDevice are made up of cubic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%e9zier_curve">Bezier
      curves</a>. Beziers are commonly used in computer graphics to draw smooth contours. A
      "curve" is defined by a starting point, an ending point, and two <i>control handles</i> that
      describe the curvature between the endpoints. The first handle describes the forward curvature of the starting point, the second handle the backward curvature of the ending point.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
<pre>
with bezier(100,100, fill=None, stroke=0) as path:
    curveto(150,100, 200,200, 50,400)
</pre>
      <p>Draws the following curve:</p>
      <div class="media" style="margin:0"><img height="364" src="../etc/tut/paths-bezier.png" width="346"/></div>

      <p>By default, the path would be filled black and drawn without a stroke color. The <code>fill</code> and <code>stroke</code> arguments override these to give us just the line itself.</p>

      <p>Note that the initial point (100,100) is set as part of the <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#bezier()">bezier()</a> call, while the destination point is the final pair of args passed to <i>curveto()</i>. Whenever you call any of the "to" commands – <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#lineto()">lineto()</a>, <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#arcto()">arcto()</a>, or <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#curveto()">curveto()</a> – it <em>implicitly</em> uses the Bezier's "current pen position" as the starting point for the next line segment. </p>



    <a id="Manipulating_Paths" name="Manipulating_Paths"></a>
      <h1>Manipulating Paths</h1>

      <p><a href="../ref/Drawing.html#Bezier">Bezier</a> objects give you access to all the points in a path as well as their control handles.
      This allows you to transform paths on the fly and even manipulate type (using the
      <a href="../ref/Typography.html#textpath()">textpath()</a> comand). Additionally, you can unite and intersect different paths or perform a variety of math operations (e.g., calculating the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of a point halfway down the path).</p>

      <h2>Paths are iterable lists of Curves</h2>

      <p>Each of the PlotDevice shape commands (<a href="../ref/Primitives.html#arc()">arc()</a>, <a href="../ref/Primitives.html#poly()">poly()</a>, etc.) returns a <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#Bezier">Bezier</a> object. This object is a list-like sequence of <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#Curve">Curve</a> objects that you can iterate over. Using the Curve's properties, you can retrieve or edit the path's vertices, control handles, and command-types (straight line, curve, move-pen, or close).</p>


      <p>Each element in the path is a <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#Curve">Curve</a>
      object with the following attributes:</p>

      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">curve.<span class="red">x</span>
curve.<span class="red">y</span></pre>
        <p>the horizontal and vertical location (as floating point numbers).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">curve.<span class="red">cmd</span></pre>
        <p>the type of line segment, either <code class="kw">LINETO</code>,
        <code class="kw">CURVETO</code>, <code class="kw">MOVETO</code> or <code class="kw">CLOSE</code></p>
      </div>

    <p>If <code>curve.cmd</code> is <code class="kw">CURVETO</code>, a pair of
      ‘control handles’ will also be defined. Each control handle is a simple <a href="../ref/Misc.html#Point">Point</a> object with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> attributes:</p>

      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">curve.<span class="red">ctrl1</span>.x
curve.<span class="red">ctrl1</span>.y</pre>
        <p>the location of the first control handle</p>
      </div>
      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">curve.<span class="red">ctrl2</span>.x
curve.<span class="red">ctrl2</span>.y</pre>
        <p>the location of the second control handle</p>
      </div>

      <p>The handles are useful for paths that consist of multiple Bezier curves. The <i>ctrl1</i>
      handle controls how the curve connects to the previous point, the <i>ctrl2</i>
      handle how the curve connects to the destination point. For example:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img height="256" src="../etc/tut/paths-ctrl1.png" width="280"/></span>
        <pre>stroke(0) and nofill()
with bezier(100,100) as path:
    curveto(150, 100, 200, 200, 150, 200)
    curveto(100, 200, 200, 350, 300, 300)
</pre>
      </div>


      <h2>Example: Letterform Vandalism</h2>

      <p>This is the path returned from the <i>textpath()</i> command for the character <i>e</i> in the <a href="http://www.underware.nl/fonts/dolly/preface">Dolly</a> typeface. Superimposed are its curves' control points:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <span><img src="../etc/tut/paths-transform-pre.png"/></span>
        <pre>
font("Dolly", "bold", 300)
path = textpath("e", 10, 150)
bezier(path, stroke='black', fill=None)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This is the same path, but modified. The location of each curve's (x,y) point is translated downwards:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img src="../etc/tut/paths-transform-post.png"/></span>
        <pre>
font("Dolly", "bold", 300)
path = textpath("e", 10, 150)
curves = []
for curve in path:
    curve.y += 20 # nudge the point downward
    curves.append(curve)

# draw a new bezier (built from our list of Curve objects)
bezier(curves, stroke='black', fill=None)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>As you can see, it's easy to manipulate a path by looping through all of its
      <em>Curve</em>s in a <a href="Repetition.html">for-loop</a> before actually drawing the
      path. Note that modifying the <i>Curve</i> objects in the for-loop does <b>not</b> affect the original path. Instead we're saving the modified <i>Curves</i> and using them to generate a brand new <i>Bezier</i> in the final line.</p>


      <p>We don't have to limit ourselves to messing with the <em>point</em> coordinates either. Here we use a similar loop to modify the path's <em>control handles</em>, letting each curving point "droop" a
      bit (let’s hope the guys at <a href="http://www.underware.nl">Underware</a> don’t freak when they see what happened their beautiful typeface):</p>

      <div class="example">
        <span><img height="87" src="../etc/tut/paths-broken.jpg" width="334"/></span>
<pre>font("Dolly", "bold", 100)
path = textpath("broken", 0,80)

curves = []
for curve in path:
    if curve.cmd == CURVETO:
        curve.ctrl2.x += 5
        curve.ctrl2.y -= 10
        curve.y += 5
    curves.append(curve)

with stroke(0), nofill():
    bezier(curves)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>With some slightly more advanced math we could create a handwritten variation of the text, or one in which each character looks a little different every time it's drawn. The examples in the <a href="Path_Filters.html">Path Filters</a> chapter should give you an idea of what's possible.</p>


    <a id="Path_Mathematics" name="Path_Mathematics"></a>
      <h1>Path Mathematics</h1>

      <p>Each of the <i>Curve</i>s that makes up a <i>Bezier</i> path has a starting point, an ending point, and control handles. What if we want to know the location of a point on the path that is not one of these endpoints, but somewhere in between? What is the location of the <em>midpoint</em> of an arc for example? The <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#Bezier">Bezier</a> object has some interesting methods we can use to answer these questions:</p>

      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">path.<span class="red">points</span>(amount=<span class="mi">100</span>) </pre>
        <p>Returns a list of <a href="../ref/Misc.html#Point">Point</a> objects, with the length of the list determined by <code>amount</code>.</p>
      </p></div>


      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">path.<span class="red">point</span>(t) </pre>
        <p>Returns a single Point located at a relative distance along the bezier. The <i>t</i> argument
          should be a value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the "time" on the path.</p>
      </p></div>

      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">path.<span class="red">insert</span>(t) </pre>
        <p>Inserts a new Point at relative-distance <i>t</i> into the path.</p>
      </p></div>

      <p>A path also has the following properties:</p>

      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">path.<span class="red">length</span></pre>
        <p>The total length of the path (e.g., the circumference when the bezier is circular).</p>
      </p></div>

      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">path.<span class="red">contours</span></pre>
        <p>A list of separate "sub-paths" in the path (each represented as a distinct Bezier object). Sub-paths occur when one or more <code class="kw">CLOSE</code> Curves are found in a path. </p>
      </p></div>

      <p>These speed-optimized commands are extremely useful when calculating orbits of animated
      elements moving down an invisible path in an animation, when creating custom type like the
      <a href="LetterKnitter.html">LetterKnitter</a>, when <a href="Path_Filters.html">growing cilia</a>
      on shapes, and so on.</p>
      <p>A special thanks goes to professor F. De Smedt at the Free University of Brussels for his
      integration and interpolation routines (see also: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casteljau%27s_algorithm">de Casteljau’s algorithm</a>).</p>

      <h2>Finding points on a path</h2>

      <p>The example below is an illustration of how points on a path can be found with <i>t</i> (a
      number between 0.0 and 1.0) representing "time" on the path. When <i>t</i> is 0.5, this
      means halfway down the path. The path's origin is at 0 and its end is at 1.</p>
      <div class="media" style="margin:0;"><img src="../etc/tut/paths-t.png" width="366", height="345"></div>

<pre>with bezier(100, 100, fill=None, stroke=0) as path:
    curveto(150, 100, 200, 150, 150, 200)
    curveto(50, 250, 200, 350, 400, 400)

for t in range(11):
    pt = path.point(0.1*t)
    oval(pt.x-2, pt.y-2, 4, 4)
</pre>

      <p>And it’s even easier using the path's <i>points()</i> method:</p>
<pre>for pt in path.points(11):
    oval(pt.x-2, pt.y-2, 4, 4)
</pre>

      <h2>Inserting points on a path</h2>

      <p>Injecting new points into the path is equally easy; just specify the <i>t</i> value where you'd like to create a new vertex. Note that this won't change the shape of the bezier, it just changes the number of elements you'll encounter when iterating through the path:</p>
      <div class="media" style="margin:0;"><img alt="pathmatics-split" src="../etc/tut/pathmatics-split.jpg"/></div>
<pre>nofill()
with bezier(100, 500, stroke=0.5, close=False) as path:
    curveto(200,250, 600,600, 400,300)

path.addpoint(0.25)
stroke(0.2)
for curve in path:
    oval(curve.x-4, curve.y-4, 8, 8)
</pre>



    <a id="Compound_paths" name="Compound_paths"></a>
      <h1>Compound Paths</h1>

      <p>So far we've talked about paths being sequences of <b>segments</b>: two points and the curve in between. A
      group of segments that has a beginning and an ending (or is "closed") is called a sub-path or <b>contour</b>.
      Character glyphs are often a composite of two contours (for example, the inner and outer oval of the
      character ‘o’). In typography it’s often useful to get the separate contours.</p>


      <div class="example">
        <span><img src="../etc/tut/pathmatics-contours.png"/></span>
        <pre>
font("Dolly", "bold", 50)
with pen(2), nofill():
    path = textpath("@#$&!", 10, 50)
    for contour in path.contours:
        stroke(HSV, random(), 1, .8)
        bezier(contour)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>But contours aren't limited to type. You can create your own compound paths by calling the shape primitives within a <i>bezier()</i> block. Rather than being drawn independently, drawing operations within the block are added to the bezier.</p>

      <p>When the bezier is finally drawn (at the end of the indented block), all the curves will have the same fill and stroke and the path will be rendered in a single operation. You'll often find it more efficient to group similarly-styled shapes into a bezier rather than drawing each separately.</p>

      <p>Note how when the lines are grouped into a single <i>Bezier</i>, their translucent strokes no longer "overlap":</p>
<div class="example">
  <span><img src="../etc/tut/paths-compound1.png"/></span>
  <pre>
stroke(0, .3) # use a translucent black
pen(4, cap=ROUND)

# draw twelve overlapping lines separately
translate(5,5)
for i in range(12):
    line(0, i*10, i*15, 120)

# draw them as a single compound-path
translate(0, 140)
with bezier():
    for i in range(12):
        line(0, i*10, i*15, 120)
</pre>
</div>

<p>You can group more than simple lines into a path. In fact, you can call any of the shape-drawing primitives as well as the <i>text()</i> command inside a <i>bezier()</i> block and they'll be added as sub-paths rather than immediately drawn to the canvas:</p>

<div class="example">
  <span><img src="../etc/tut/paths-compound2.png"/></span>
  <pre>
# capture the bezier into the `path` variable
with bezier(plot=False) as path:
    for x,y in grid(10,10, 20,20):
        shape = choice([rect, oval])
        shape(x,y, 15,15)

# apply a gradient fill color to the compound path
fill('green', 'cyan')
bezier(path)
</pre>
</div>






      <h2>Flattening operations</h2>

      <p>Paths can be combined using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">boolean</a> set operations. This means you can create a
      new <b>compound path from a combination of other paths</b>. This is useful if you want to
      create a shape from a mixture of other shapes (like ovals and rectangles) and then
      flatten the group into a single path (with no overlaps). Manipulating a single shape is both faster and easier than manipulating a group of shapes.</p>

      <p>Each of the following methods returns a new <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#Bezier">Bezier</a> created by
      merging the two given paths. The manner in which the new path is traced differs for each
      method:</p>

      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">path.<span class="red">union</span>(path2, flatness=<span class="mi">0.6</span>) </pre>
        <p>Traces and merges the two paths, removing any overlapping parts.</p>
      </p></div>

      <div class="example">
        <span><img src="../etc/tut/paths-flat-union.png"/></span>
        <pre>
path1 = arc( 50,50, 40, plot=False)
path2 = arc(100,50, 40, plot=False)
compound = path1.union(path2)
with stroke(0), nofill():
    bezier(compound)
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">path.<span class="red">intersect</span>(path2, flatness=<span class="mi">0.6</span>) </pre>
        <p>Traces the overlapping region and removes everything else.</p>
      </p></div>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img src="../etc/tut/paths-flat-intersect.png"/></span>
        <pre>
path1 = arc( 50,50, 40, plot=False)
path2 = arc(100,50, 40, plot=False)
compound = path1.intersect(path2)
with stroke(0), nofill():
    bezier(compound)
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">path.<span class="red">difference</span>(path2, flatness=<span class="mi">0.6</span>) </pre>
        <p>Subtracts the second shape from the first shape.</p>
      </p></div>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img src="../etc/tut/paths-flat-difference.png"/></span>
        <pre>
path1 = arc( 50,50, 40, plot=False)
path2 = arc(100,50, 40, plot=False)
compound = path1.difference(path2)
with stroke(0), nofill():
    bezier(compound)
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="def-box">
        <pre class="manual">path.<span class="red">xor</span>(path2, flatness=<span class="mi">0.6</span>) </pre>
        <p>Traces non-overlapping regions, excluding any areas that overlap.</p>
      </p></div>
      <div class="example">
        <span><img src="../etc/tut/paths-flat-xor.png"/></span>
        <pre>

compound = path1.xor(path2)
with stroke(0), fill(0.8):
    bezier(compound)
</pre>
      </div>


      <p>The returned path can be manipulated like any other <i>Bezier</i>. You can <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#fill()">fill()</a> and <a href="../ref/Line+Color.html#stroke()">stroke()</a> it, <a href="../ref/Transform.html#rotate()">rotate()</a> it then draw it (or multiple copies of it)
      onscreen by passing it to <a href="../ref/Drawing.html#bezier()">bezier()</a>.</p>

      <p>One thing to note is that the compound path will not contain any curves. Instead, it is
      made up of numerous straight line segments (which is why we say the path has been "flattened").
      Each of the compound methods has an optional <i>flatness</i> parameter. The lower it gets,
      the more line segments will be drawn (and hence the smoother the resulting shape).</p>

      <h2>Constructing a flattened path</h2>

      <p>Using a for-loop we can repeatedly create new sub-paths to build up a compound path. In the example below,
      we create a number of circles varying in size, then append them to one flattened compound
      path:</p>
<pre>compound = None
for i in range(50):
    r = random(75)
    path = oval(random(300), random(200), r, r, plot=False)
    if not compound:
        compound = path
    compound = compound.union(path)
bezier(compound, fill=None, stroke=0)
</pre> 

      <div class="media" style="margin:0;"><img alt="paths-compound4" src="../etc/tut/paths-flattened4.jpg"/></div>

      <h2>Using a Transform object</h2>

      <p>It’s easy enough to draw transformed and colored copies of the compound path, but what if
      we want to <b>rotate and scale the individual shapes</b> before flattening them? We can use
      the <a href="../ref/Transform.html#Transform">Transform</a> object for this purpose.</p>
<pre># We construct our indivual shape in the top-left corner.
# This is where corner-mode transforms originate.
# We'll later on place the eventual compound path
# where we want it with translate().
path = rect(-10, 0, 20, 100, plot=False)

# Let's chip away small piece of the rectangle:
path = path.difference(rect(-15, 80, 20, 15, plot=False))

# Create a rotation transform we'll repeatedly apply to a path
t = Transform()
t.rotate(20)

compound = path
for i in range(17):
    # Before adding the rectangle shape to
    # the flattened compound, we rotate it a bit.
    path = t.apply(path)
    compound = compound.union(path)

translate(275, 275)
nofill()
stroke(0)
bezier(compound)
</pre>

      <div class="media" style="margin:0;"><img alt="paths-compound5" src="../etc/tut/paths-flattened5.jpg"/></div>

      <p>Try adjusting the number of iterations through the for-loop to see where our wheel-like final shape comes from.</p>

    <a id="Clamping_paths" name="Clamping_paths"></a>
    <h1>Clamping Paths</h1>

      <p>Paths can be <b>forced to fit</b> a bounding box. Then as the size of the box
      is adjusted the path will stretch accordingly. This "reverse" logic is useful in
      situations where a path needs to exactly fit an area and we don’t want to be bothered with
      creating the shape in exactly the right proportions or at the right position.</p>

      <div class="def-box">

      </p></div>

<pre>
</pre>

      <p>All of the parameters are optional so you can define any combination of them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>x</i>: the path will be positioned at the specified x value.
        </li><li><i>y</i>: the path will be positioned at the specified y value.
        </li><li><i>width</i>: the path will be of the specified width.
        </li><li><i>height</i>: the path will be of the specified height.
        </li><li><i>stretch</i>: if both width and height are defined, either stretch the path or preserve
        the aspect ratio.
