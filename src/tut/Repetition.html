    <p>Repetition is what computers are really good at; you can ask them to do the same thing over and over again and they will never grow bored. This is the main advantage of using code as a design tool; you don’t have to do everything by yourself again and again. Once your code works for a single case, you can sit back and let the computer handle the next dozen, hundred, or bajillion items.</p>

    <h1>The <code>for</code> Loop</h1>

    <p>In programming circles, doing the same thing multiple times is generally called "iteration" or, more colloquially, a "loop". Python provides a concise syntax for looping over a
    set of values through its "<code>for … in …:</code>" syntax. The first ellipsis should
    be replaced with a variable name – the loop's "counter". The second ellipsis should be a list
    or other sequence type (to be stepped through item-by-item).</p>

    <p>The statement should look like this:</p>
    <pre>for variable in sequence:
    ... # commands
</pre>

    <p>Don’t forget the <strong>colon</strong> at the end of the <code>for</code> statement! The colon and the indentation of the next line(s) are how Python recognizes the beginning and end of the loop.</p>

    <h2>The <em>variable</em> part</h2>

    <p>The <em>variable</em> can have any name you like (as you already know if you've read about
    <a href="Variables.html">variables</a>). This variable holds the "current" item as you step through the indented code again and again.</p>
    <p>A common name for it is <code>i</code>, especially in cases where you're looping over a sequence of numbers and the variable is functioning as a "counter". This is an echo from basic math where counters are generally named <code>i</code> as well.</p>

    <p>It’s short, and it’s a good convention with a long history.</p>
    <h2>The <em>sequence</em> part</h2>

    <p>The <em>sequence</em> part is a <a href="Collections.html">collection</a> of elements, most commonly a <a href="Collections.html#list">list</a>. The elements of the sequence can be anything you like: numbers, <a href="Strings.html">strings</a>, <a href="Color.html">colors</a>, and so on. Each element is consecutively assigned to the <em>variable</em>.</p>

    <p>So if <em>sequence</em> were <code>[<code class="str">"ready"</code>, <code class="str">"steady"</code>, <code class="str">"GO!"</code>]</code>, the commands in the for-loop would be executed three times. The <em>variable</em> will be assigned <code class="str">"ready"</code> the first time through the loop, <code class="str">"steady"</code> the second time, and <code class="str">"GO!"</code> the third time:</p>
<pre>for item in ["ready", "steady", "GO!"]:
  print(item)
>>> ready
>>> steady
>>> GO!
</pre>

<p>If you want your loop to execute a fixed number of times, try using the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range">range()</a> function. When you use a range, the loop will run once for each value from zero up to (but not including) the number you pass as the range argument.</p>

<pre>for item in range(3):
    print(item)
>>> 0
>>> 1
>>> 2
</pre>

    <h2>The <em>commands</em> part</h2>

    <p>The <em>commands</em> part consists of one or more PlotDevice commands that need to be executed repeatedly.
    They are indented beneath the for-statement. The script is ‘trapped’ in a loop here and
    keeps executing the indented commands until each element from <em>list</em> has consecutively
    been assigned to <em>variable</em>.</p>

    <p>What makes this powerful is being able to use the <em>variable</em>'s value in each loop. You'll notice that in both of the previous examples the <i>commands</i> part is identical. It's simply printing things out.</p>

    <p>Calling <code>print</code> <code>item</code> is an "abstract" command: when PlotDevice
    goes through the loop <em>item</em> is replaced with each element in the list. Thus you get different output each time the line executes (even though it's the <em>same code statement</em> every time).</p>






    <h1>Looping over Collections</h1>

    <p>You can use either of the collection types (<a href="Collections.html#lists">lists</a> or <a href="Collections.html#dictionaries">dicts</a>) as the sequence in a loop. So far we've seen the "typical" case in which you loop over the elements of a list, but both types provide some handy mechanisms for controlling how you step through them.</p>


    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>Using a simple "<em>for … in</em>" loop only gives you the <em>values</em> from the list. If you also need the <em>index</em> within the loop, use the convenient <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumerate">enumerate()</a> command. It provides you with a sequence of index/value <em>pairs</em>, one for each item in the list:</p>
    <pre>
shortlist = ['first', 'middle', 'last']
for i, name in enumerate(shortlist):
    print("item", i, "is:", name)
>>> item 0 is first
>>> item 1 is middle
>>> item 2 is last
</pre>




    <h2>Dictionaries</h2>

    <p>Dictionaries support the same "<em>for … in</em>" syntax as lists. But where list iteration steps through <em>values</em>, dict iteration steps through <em>keys</em>. Here we iterate through keys and manually retrieve the values from our dictionary:</p>
    <pre>info = dict(series=9000, instructor="Langley", operational="1992/01/12")
for key in info:
    val = info[key]
    print(key, val)
>>> series 9000
>>> instructor Langley
>>> operational 1992/01/12
</pre>
    <p>You can also iterate through key/value <em>pairs</em> using the <i>dict.<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#dict.items">items()</a></i> method. In this case your <i>for</i> statement should declare two variables (separated by a comma) to refer to the key and value respectively:</p>
    <pre>for key, val in list(info.items()):
    print(key, val)</pre>






    <h1>Loops and Randomness</h1>

    <p>For-loops and the <a href="../ref/Misc.html#random()">random()</a> command work really well together. You can draw a hundred circles for
    example, and have PlotDevice place each of them at random locations. This way, each time you run
    the script, you get a different composition of circles.</p>
    <p>It’s easy to program a ‘style’ with variations this way.</p>
<pre>... # set up your style

# draw randomly in that style
for i in range(100):
    x = random(HEIGHT)
    y = random(WIDTH)
    r = random(25, 50)
    arc(x, y, r)
</pre>

    <h2>Random items from a list</h2>

    <p>You can let the computer decide on its own which items to draw from the list by using the
    <a href="../ref/Misc.html#choice()">choice()</a> command. Each time you call <i>choice()</i> it returns a randomly selected value from the list. Since each of these "choices" is independent, it's quite possible that you'll receive the same value more than once during a sequnce of calls.</p>

    <p>If your goal is to reorder the items in a list while ensuring that each element only appears once, use the <a href="../ref/Misc.html#shuffled()">shuffled()</a> command. Calling <i>shuffled()</i> doesn't actually modify the list you pass to it; instead it generates a new, permuted list with the same values as your original. You can store this permutation in another value, or iterate through it immediately:</p>
    <pre>
alphabet = ['a','b','c','d']
print(shuffled(alphabet))
>>> ['b', 'c', 'a', 'd']

for letter in shuffled(alphabet):
    print(letter)
>>> a
>>> c
>>> d
>>> b
</pre>

    <h2>Putting it all together</h2>

    <p>Here's a dead-simple example of how you would use random choice with small lists to generate compositions. The script defines a pair of lists; one of possible words, and another with selected colors. Everything beyond point in the script is entirely stochastic and will generate different output on every run.</p>
    <p>It picks random words and colors from the two lists then draws them to the screen with random sizes and rotations. It retains a certain coherence between different runs because of the limited set of words and colors.</p>

    <pre>words = ["Lists", "are", "fun"]
colors = [color(1,0,0), color(1,1,1), color(0,0,0)]

for i in range(40):
    x = random(WIDTH)
    y = random(HEIGHT)
    rotate(random(360))
    fontsize(random(10,100))

    fill(choice(colors))
    text(choice(words), x, y)
</pre>
