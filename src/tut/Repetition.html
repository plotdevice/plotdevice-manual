    <p>Repetition is what computers are really good at; they never grow bored, you can ask them to
    do the same thing over and over again and they will never stop liking it. And they’re fast at
    calculating too.</p>

    <p>This is the main advantage of using code as a design tool; you don’t have to do everything by
    yourself again and again. Once you get the first time right, just let the computer
    handle the hundred other times.</p>
    <h3>The <code>for</code> loop</h3>

    <p>In programming, iteration (doing the same thing multiple times) is generally
    called a <em>loop</em>. Python provides a concise syntax for looping over a
    set of values through its "<code>for … in …:</code>" statement. The first ellipsis should
    be replaced with a variable name – the loop's "counter". The second ellipsis should be a list
    or other sequence type (to be stepped through item-by-item).</p>

    <p>The statement should look like this:</p>
    <pre>for variable in list:
    ... # do something
</pre>

    <p>Don’t forget the <strong>colon</strong> at the end of the <code>for</code> statement! The colon and the indentation of the next line(s) are what let Python determine the beginning and end of the loop.</p>

    <h2>The <em>variable</em> part</h2>

    <p>The <em>variable</em> can have any name you like (as you already know if you've read about
    <a href="Variables.html">variables</a>). This variable holds the "current" count as you step through the indented code again and again. A
    common name for it is <em>i</em>, a residue of basic math where counters are generally named
    <em>i</em> as well.</p>
    <p>It’s short, and it’s a good convention with a long history.</p>
    <h2>The <em>list</em> part</h2>

    <p>The <em>list</em> part is a <a href="Collections.html">collection</a> of numbers or elements.
    Each element in the sequence is consecutively assigned to the <em>variable</em>. A for-loop can step through anything you like: numbers, <a href="Strings.html">strings</a>, <a href="Color.html">colors</a>, and so on.</p>

    <p>So if <em>list</em> were <code>[<code class="str">"apple"</code>, <code class="str">"pear"</code>, <code class="str">"banana"</code>]</code>, the commands in the for-loop would be
    executed three times, with <em>variable</em> consecutively being <code class="str">"apple"</code> the first time,
    <code class="str">"pear"</code> the second time, and <code class="str">"banana"</code> the third time:</p>
<pre>for i in ["apple", "pear", "banana"]:
  print i
>>> apple
>>> pear
>>> banana
</pre>

<p>If you want your loop to execute a fixed number of times, try using the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range">range()</a> function. When you use a range, the loop will run once for each value from zero up to (but not including) the number you pass as the range argument.</p>

<pre>for i in range(3):
    print i
>>> 0
>>> 1
>>> 2
</pre>

    <h2>The <em>do stuff</em> part</h2>

    <p>The <em>do stuff</em> part consists of one or more PlotDevice commands that need to be executed repeatedly.
    They are indented beneath the for-statement. The script is ‘trapped’ in a loop here and
    keeps executing the indented commands until each element from <em>list</em> has consecutively
    been assigned to <em>variable</em>.</p>

    <p>What makes this powerful is being able to use the <em>variable</em>'s value in each loop. Like in the
    example above, where we had a little loop that went through all the fruit in the list and
    printed out each piece of fruit. Calling <code>print i</code> is an abstract command: when PlotDevice
    goes through the loop <em>i</em> is replaced with each element in the list, thus you get different output each time the line executes (even though it's the <em>same</em> code statement every time).</p>

    <h2>For-loops and <i>random()</i></h2>

    <p>For-loops and the <a href="../ref/Misc.html#random()">random()</a> command work really well together. You can draw a hundred circles for
    example, and have PlotDevice place each of them at random locations. This way, each time you run
    the script, you get a different composition of circles.</p>
    <p>It’s easy to program a ‘style’ with variations this way.</p>
<pre>for i in range(100):
    x = random(HEIGHT)
    y = random(WIDTH)
    r = random(25, 50)
    arc(x, y, r)
</pre>
