    <p>Repetition is what computers are really good at; you can ask them to do the same thing over and over again and they will never grow bored. This is the main advantage of using code as a design tool; you don’t have to do everything by yourself again and again. Once your code works for a single case, you can sit back and let the computer handle the next dozen, hundred, or bajillion items.</p>

    <h1>The <code>for</code> loop</h1>

    <p>In programming, doing the same thing multiple times is generally called "iteration" or, more colloquially, a "loop". Python provides a concise syntax for looping over a
    set of values through its "<code>for … in …:</code>" syntax. The first ellipsis should
    be replaced with a variable name – the loop's "counter". The second ellipsis should be a list
    or other sequence type (to be stepped through item-by-item).</p>

    <p>The statement should look like this:</p>
    <pre>for variable in sequence:
    ... # commands
</pre>

    <p>Don’t forget the <strong>colon</strong> at the end of the <code>for</code> statement! The colon and the indentation of the next line(s) are how Python recognizes the beginning and end of the loop.</p>

    <h2>The <em>variable</em> part</h2>

    <p>The <em>variable</em> can have any name you like (as you already know if you've read about
    <a href="Variables.html">variables</a>). This variable holds the "current" item as you step through the indented code again and again.</p>
    <p>A common name for it is <code>i</code>, especially in cases where you're looping over a sequence of numbers and the variable is functioning as a "counter". This is an echo from basic math where counters are generally named <code>i</code> as well.</p>

    <p>It’s short, and it’s a good convention with a long history.</p>
    <h2>The <em>sequence</em> part</h2>

    <p>The <em>sequence</em> part is a <a href="Collections.html">collection</a> of elements, most commonly a <a href="Collections.html#list">list</a>. The elements of the sequence can be anything you like: numbers, <a href="Strings.html">strings</a>, <a href="Color.html">colors</a>, and so on. Each element is consecutively assigned to the <em>variable</em>.</p>

    <p>So if <em>sequence</em> were <code>[<code class="str">"ready"</code>, <code class="str">"steady"</code>, <code class="str">"GO!"</code>]</code>, the commands in the for-loop would be executed three times. The <em>variable</em> will be assigned <code class="str">"ready"</code> the first time through the loop, <code class="str">"steady"</code> the second time, and <code class="str">"GO!"</code> the third time:</p>
<pre>for item in ["ready", "steady", "GO!"]:
  print item
>>> ready
>>> steady
>>> GO!
</pre>

<p>If you want your loop to execute a fixed number of times, try using the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range">range()</a> function. When you use a range, the loop will run once for each value from zero up to (but not including) the number you pass as the range argument.</p>

<pre>for item in range(3):
    print item
>>> 0
>>> 1
>>> 2
</pre>

    <h2>The <em>commands</em> part</h2>

    <p>The <em>commands</em> part consists of one or more PlotDevice commands that need to be executed repeatedly.
    They are indented beneath the for-statement. The script is ‘trapped’ in a loop here and
    keeps executing the indented commands until each element from <em>list</em> has consecutively
    been assigned to <em>variable</em>.</p>

    <p>What makes this powerful is being able to use the <em>variable</em>'s value in each loop. You'll notice that in both of the previous examples the <i>commands</i> part is identical. It's simply printing things out.</p>

    <p>Calling <code>print</code> <code>item</code> is an "abstract" command: when PlotDevice
    goes through the loop <em>item</em> is replaced with each element in the list. Thus you get different output each time the line executes (even though it's the <em>same code statement</em> every time).</p>

    <h2>For-loops and randomness</h2>

    <p>For-loops and the <a href="../ref/Misc.html#random()">random()</a> command work really well together. You can draw a hundred circles for
    example, and have PlotDevice place each of them at random locations. This way, each time you run
    the script, you get a different composition of circles.</p>
    <p>It’s easy to program a ‘style’ with variations this way.</p>
<pre>... # set up your style

# draw randomly in that style
for i in range(100):
    x = random(HEIGHT)
    y = random(WIDTH)
    r = random(25, 50)
    arc(x, y, r)
</pre>
