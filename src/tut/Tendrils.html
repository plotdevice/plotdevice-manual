    <p><span class="big_text">I had some code lying around which I thought I’d share with you. It
    is an adaption of a Processing algorithm by <a href="http://www.artcom.de/process/">ART+COM</a>, visualizing an elegant growing plant.</span></p>
    <p>The source code has been organized in two simple classes so it might help you when learning
    from the <a href="Classes.html">tutorial on classes</a>. The first class, <i>Tendril</i>,
    defines a single branch in the plant. As it grows it calculates the position of new segments by
    steering its current heading a bit to the left or right, hence the spiraling shape. The second
    class, <i>Plant</i>, defines a group of tendrils. It has some simple methods to grow and draw
    all the tendrils together.</p>

    <h2>Using the plant as a layer in Core Image</h2>

    <p>With a simple adaption we can use the <i>plant.path()</i> method as input for <a href="../lib/Core_Image.html">Core Image</a>. This way we can transform the plant shape as a layer
    of pixel data. Simply add the lines of code below the image to the bottom of the script, and
    play around with the <i>curl</i> parameter a bit.</p>
