    <p><a href="Variables.html">Variables</a> often store pieces of text, called <em>strings</em>,
    that will be drawn to the screen.</p>
    <p>When a piece of text, a string, is assigned to a variable, it needs to be <strong>wrapped in
    quotes</strong>; it needs to start and end with a quote. Otherwise PlotDevice might think the
    piece of text is the name of a variable, or something else.</p>
    <p>Consider the following example:</p>
<pre>hello = 20
str = hello
print str
&gt;&gt;&gt; 20
 
str = "hello"
print str
&gt;&gt;&gt; hello
</pre>

    <h2>Strings are lists of characters</h2>

    <p>A string is like a <a href="Lists.html">list</a> of individual characters. This way, you
    could access each character in the string like any other list. In the example below, I make
    handy use of this feature by selecting random characters from the <em>chars</em> string with
    the <a href="../ref/Utility.html#choice()">choice()</a> command and drawing them to the screen
    <a href="http://www.joshuadavis.com">Joshua Davis</a>-style.</p>
    <p> </p>

    <p> </p>
    <h2>Manipulating strings</h2>

    <p>Strings have a number of very useful methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>string</em>.upper(): returns the string in uppercase.
      </li><li><em>string</em>.lower(): returns the string in lowercase.
      </li><li><em>string</em>.capitalize(): returns the string with the first character capitalized.
      </li><li><em>string</em>.find(<em>text</em>, start=0): returns the index position of <em>text</em>
      in the string.
      </li><li><em>string</em>.replace(<em>old</em>, <em>new</em>): replaces all <em>old</em> text in
      the string with <em>new</em>
      </li><li><em>string</em>.split(): returns the string as a list of words.
      </li><li><em>string</em>.join(<em>list</em>): concatenates a list of words.
    </li></ul>

    <p>Strings can be converted to uppercase and lowercase with the <em>upper()</em> and
    <em>lower()</em> methods, or have the first character capitalized with <em>capitalize</em>.
    Remember, these are methods, so instead of saying <em>str = upper(str)</em> you need to say
    <em>str = str.upper()</em>.</p>
<pre>str = "Kumquats, Kumquats! I must have my Kumquats! - Oscar Wilde"
str = str.upper() 
print str 
&gt;&gt;&gt; KUMQUATS, KUMQUATS! I MUST HAVE MY KUMQUATS! - OSCAR WILDE
</pre>

    <p>The <em>replace()</em> method is especially useful when you want to filter mistakes from the
    string, or when you want to alter portions of the content:</p>
<pre>str = "Something's rotten in the state of Denmark."
str = str.replace("in", "in, like, ")
str = str.replace(".", " dude.")
str = str.replace("rotten", "way uncool")
print str
&gt;&gt;&gt; Something's way uncool in, like, the state of Denmark dude.
</pre>

    <h2>Quotes in quotes</h2>

    <p>Text data often contain quotes themselves, especially if the text contains dialogue. When
    PlotDevice examines the string and encounters such a quote, it would logically assume that the
    string is terminated here.</p>
    <p>The following example won’t work, PlotDevice thinks <em>(On his death bed):</em> needs to be
    assigned to <em>str</em>, followed by garbage statements it doesn’t understand:</p>
<pre>str = "(On his death bed): "Those curtains are hideous." - Oscar Wilde"
</pre>

    <p>Instead, the string needs to be wrapped in triple quotes:</p>
<pre>str = """(On his death bed): "Those curtains are hideous." - Oscar Wilde""" 
print str 
&gt;&gt;&gt; (On his death bed): "Those curtains are hideous." - Oscar Wilde
</pre>

    <h2>File input</h2>

    <p>When you’re going to use long paragraphs of text, it’s better to store the text in a
    separate text file and assign that to a variable, this keeps your script clean, and you can
    edit the text separately from the script.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="media"><img alt="" height="334" src="../etc/tut/strings-textedit.jpg" width="653"/></span></p>
    <p><span class="media"><img alt="" height="504" src="../etc/tut/strings-file.jpg" width="659"/></span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Simply put the text in TextEdit, <strong>make it plain text</strong>, and import it into
    your script with the <a href="../ref/Utility.html#open()">open()</a> command.</p>
    <h2>Unicode characters</h2>

    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> is a character system that allows
    computers to use symbols from all of the writing systems in the world. If you’re going to use
    for example <em>suomi</em> or <em>Hebrew</em> in the output of your script, you’ll have to know
    about Unicode.</p>
    <p>The first thing to make sure is that the <strong>typeface</strong> you are going to use
    includes Unicode characters, so the text can be drawn in the font. Usually, large font families
    like Helvetica include Unicode for almost any Unicode character.</p>
    <p>Next, you’ll have to tell PlotDevice that a piece of text includes special characters. This is
    as simple as adding a ‘<strong>u’</strong> to the front of the string quotes.</p>
<pre>str = u"?אתה מדבר אנגלית"
text(str, 50, 200)
</pre>

    <p> </p>
    <p><img alt="strings-unicode1" height="459" src="../etc/tut/strings-unicode1.jpg" width="658"/></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>When you are going to import text from a text file there are two things to look out for.
    First, the text file needs to <strong>saved as Unicode</strong>. In TextEdit, apply the plain
    text format and when you save it, select ‘Unicode (UTF-8)’ from the Plain Text Encoding list.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><img alt="strings-unicode2" height="446" src="../etc/tut/strings-unicode2.jpg" width="657"/></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Then when you import the contents of the file into PlotDevice, you’ll have to
    <strong>decode</strong> the text:</p>
<pre>str = open("hebrew.txt").read()
str = str.decode("utf-8")
align(RIGHT)
text(str, 100, 200)
</pre>

    <p> </p>
