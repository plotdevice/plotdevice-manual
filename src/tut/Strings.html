    <p><a href="Variables.html">Variables</a> often store pieces of text, called <em>strings</em>,
    that will be drawn to the screen.</p>
    <p>When a string is assigned to a variable, the text needs to be <strong>wrapped in
    quotes</strong>. You can use either <code class="str">'single'</code> or <code class="str">"double"</code> quotation marks. Otherwise PlotDevice will think the piece of text is the name of a variable:</p>
<pre class="manual">txt = hello
<span class="grey">>>> </span><span class="red">NameError: name 'hello' is not defined</span>
</pre><pre>
txt = "hello"
print txt
>>> hello
</pre>

    <h2>Strings are lists of characters</h2>

    <p>A string is like a <a href="Collections.html#lists">list</a> of individual characters. You
    can access each character in the string by putting the "index" number in brackets. You can also access substrings by passing a start- and end-index spearated by a colon. Note that just like "slices" of a list, the end-index is <em>not</em> included in the sub-range returned.</p>
    <pre>alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
alphabet[0]   # returns 'a'
alphabet[-1]  # 'z'
alphabet[:4]  # 'abcd'
alphabet[1:4] # 'bcd'
alphabet[-3:] # 'xyz'
</pre>

    <p>The <a href="../ref/Misc.html#choice()">choice()</a> command selects either a random element from a list or a random character from a string (depending on which kind of value you pass to it). In the example below, we use <i>choice()</i> and <i>random()</i> to select 80 characters from the alphabet and scatter them over the screen at random positions, sizes, and orientations.</p>

    <h2>Manipulating strings</h2>

    <p>Python strings have a number of very useful methods:</p>

    <div class="def-box">
      <pre class="manual">str.<span class="red">upper</span>()</pre>
      <p>returns an uppercase copy of the string</p>
    </div>
    <div class="def-box">
      <pre class="manual">str.<span class="red">lower</span>()</pre>
      <p>returns a lowercase copy of the string</p>
    </div>
    <div class="def-box">
      <pre class="manual">str.<span class="red">capitalize</span>()</pre>
      <p>returns a copy of the string with the first character capitalized</p>
    </div>
    <div class="def-box">
      <pre class="manual">str.<span class="red">title</span>()</pre>
      <p>returns a copy of the string with the first character of each word capitalized</p>
    </div>
    <div class="def-box">
      <pre class="manual">str.<span class="red">find</span>(txt, start=0)</pre>
      <p>returns the index position of <code>txt</code> in the string</p>
    </div>
    <div class="def-box">
      <pre class="manual">str.<span class="red">replace</span>(old, new)</pre>
      <p>returns a copy of the string with all instances of <code>old</code> replaced by <code>new</code></p>
    </div>
    <div class="def-box">
      <pre class="manual">str.<span class="red">split</span>()</pre>
      <p>returns the list of words (separated by whitespace) in the string</p>
    </div>
    <div class="def-box">
      <pre class="manual">str.<span class="red">join</span>(lst)</pre>
      <p>returns a string formed by concatenating all the items of <code>lst</code> with <code>str</code> separating them</p>
    </div>

    <p>Keep in mind that these are <em>methods</em> of the string object itself, not commands. So rather than calling then with your string as an argument:</p>
    <pre>lower(txt) # bzzzt, wrong</pre>

    <p>you need to use "dot notation" to access the string's method instead:</p>
    <pre>txt.lower() # hooray, success</pre>

    <p>All the string methods leave your original string untouched and instead return a new copy that's been modified accordingly:</p>

<pre>txt = "Ask me, ask me, ask me"
print txt.title()
print txt.upper()
print txt
>>> Ask Me, Ask Me, Ask Me
>>> ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME
>>> Ask me, ask me, ask me
</pre>


    <p>The <em>replace()</em> method is especially useful when you want to filter mistakes from the
    string or otherwise alter portions of the content:</p>
<pre>txt = "There's more to life than code, you know."
txt = txt.replace("code", "books")
txt = txt.replace(".", ". But not much more...")
print txt
>>> There's more to life than books, you know. But not much more...
</pre>
    <p>If your search &amp; replace needs are more complex, Python has a powerful <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html">Regular Expressions</a> library available to you. Add <code>import</code> <code>re</code> to the top of your script and you'll have access to useful methods like:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a class="noexternal" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.search">re.search</a><em>(regex, str)</em>: return a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.MatchObject">match</a> if the pattern was found in <i>str</i> or <code class="kw">None</code> if it wasn't.</li>
        <li><a class="noexternal" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.sub">re.sub</a><em>(regex, new, orig)</em>: return a string derived from <i>orig</i> in which each occurrance of a pattern is replaced with <i>new</i>.</li>
        <li><a class="noexternal" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.split">re.split</a><em>(regex, str)</em>: return a list of substrings, using the pattern to divide the original string.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>String formatting</h2>

    <p>We've seen that the <code>print</code> statement allows you to combine multiple variables when generating output. It even adds a space character between terms separated by commas. But mixing strings and values like this gets hard to edit as your code gets more complex. An alternative approach is to use ‘string interpolation’ to generate a new string with your values inserted at specific locations according to a template.</p>

    <p>Python has two syntaxes for this: the ‘new’ style using the string's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language">format()</a> method, and the ‘old’ style using printf-style escapes and the <a href="http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/python/web/old-str-format.html"><code>%</code> operator</a>. Personally, I still prefer the older approach, but your mileage may vary.</p>

    <p>Here's an old-style formatting example. The basic usage is <code>template % values</code>. If you're inserting multiple values, be sure to wrap them in parentheses separated by commas:</p>
    <pre>pastry = 'pie'
num = [4, 20]
price = 12.5
txt = '%i &amp; %i blackbirds baked in a %s: $%0.2f' % (num[0], num[1], pastry, price)
print txt
>>> 4 &amp; 20 blackbirds baked in a pie: $12.50
</pre>

    <p>If you want your string to contain a literal <code class="str">"%"</code> character, put a <code class="str">"%%"</code> in your format instead:</p>
    <pre>print "(plus %i%% sales tax)" % 5
>>> (plus 5% sales tax)</pre>

    <h2>Quotes in quotes</h2>

    <p>Text strings often contain quotation marks as <em>content</em>, especially if the text contains dialogue. When PlotDevice examines the string and encounters such a quote, it would logically assume that the string is terminated here.</p>

    <p>For instance, the following example won’t work:</p>
<pre>txt = "(On his death bed): "Those curtains are hideous." - Oscar Wilde"</pre>

    <p>PlotDevice sees <code class="str">"(On his death bed): "</code> as a complete string followed by garbage statements it doesn’t understand.</p>

    <p>To get around this, take your pick of either double- or single-quotes when defining a string. Whichever one you start the string with will also be used for determining where the string ends. If double-quotes are part of the <em>content</em> of our string, we might choose to wrap it in single-quotes (and vice versa):</p>
    <pre>txt = '(On his death bed): "Those curtains are hideous." - Oscar Wilde'</pre>
    <p>Or, if we've got a lot of single-quotes in the content, we can wrap it in double-quotes:</p>
    <pre>txt = "You can't / you won't / and you don't / stop."</pre>

    <p>But if our string contains both kinds of quotes, this approach doesn't help us. For these cases we can use triple-quotes to delimit the string and mix-and-match quotation marks within it:</p>

    <pre>txt = """John Cage's 4'33" (performed by the Boston Typewriter Orchestra)"""</pre>

    <p>Triple-quoted strings are also unique in being able to span <b>multiple lines</b>. Each carriage return will be converted to a newline character in the string it assigns. Single- and double-quoted strings <em>must</em> begin and end on the same line of your script. If you want to include line breaks in a non-triple-quoted string, use the ‘escape’ code for the newline character: <code class="str">"\n"</code>.</p>


    <h2>File input</h2>

    <p>When you’re going to typeset long paragraphs of text, it’s better to store the text in a
    separate text file and then read its contents into a variable. This keeps your script clean, and you can
    edit the text separately from the script.</p>

    <p>The text file you create must be <em>plain</em> text devoid of styling (PlotDevice doesn't speak RTF or <code>.docx</code>). If you use a text-editor like <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a>, or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> any files you create will be plaintext by default. If you're using the built-in TextEdit application, the first thing you'll need to do upon creating a new document is disable formatting:</p>
    <div class="media" style="margin:0;"><img alt="" height="248" src="../etc/tut/strings-plaintext.png" width="247"/></div>

    <p>You can then compose whatever text you'd like (or, if you're like me, lazily paste in something interesting from Wikipedia). Save the file to a convenient folder and remember its file path so you can access it from your script:</p>


    <div class="media"><img alt="" height="510" src="../etc/tut/strings-textedit.png" width="574"/></div>

    <p>Within our PlotDevice script, we can read the contents of the file into a string using the <a href="../ref/Misc.html#read()">read()</a> command. Note that when we draw the string (by passing it to <a href="../ref/Typography.html#text()">text()</a>) we make sure to include a <code>width</code> argument. Otherwise there'd be no line-breaking and text would go spilling off the right side of the canvas:</p>

    <div class="media"><img alt="" height="608" src="../etc/tut/strings-file.png" width="801"/></div>

    <a name="Unicode"></a>
    <h2>Unicode characters</h2>

    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> is a character system that allows
    computers to use symbols from all of the writing systems in the world. If you’re going to use
    for example <em>suomi</em> or <em>Hebrew</em> in the output of your script, you’ll have to know
    about Unicode.</p>

    <p>The first thing to check is that the <strong>typeface</strong> you are going to use
    includes Unicode characters. Large font families like Helvetica usually include glyphs for almost any Unicode character.</p>
    <p>Next, you’ll have to tell PlotDevice that a piece of text includes special characters. This is
    as simple as adding a ‘<strong>u’</strong> to the front of the string quotes.</p>
<pre>the_rain_in_magyar = u"Az eső Spanyolországban esik főleg a síkságon"
text(the_rain_in_magyar, 20,60, width=240)
</pre>

    <div class="media"><img height="406" src="../etc/tut/strings-unicode1.png" width="748"/></div>
    <p>When you are going to import text from a text file there are two things to look out for.
    First, the text file needs to <strong>saved as Unicode</strong>. In TextEdit, apply the plain
    text format and when you save it, select ‘Unicode (UTF-8)’ from the Plain Text Encoding list.</p>
    <div class="media"><img height="556" src="../etc/tut/strings-unicode2.png" width="573"/></div>

    <p>Then when you import the contents of the file into PlotDevice, you’ll have to
    <strong>decode</strong> the text from UTF-8 into unicode:</p>
<pre>txt = open("hebrew.txt").read()
txt = txt.decode("utf-8")
align(RIGHT)
text(txt, 100, 200)
</pre>

    <p>PlotDevice provides a <a href="../ref/Misc.html#read()">read()</a> command that does the file i/o and unicode conversion for you. By default it will attempt to decode the file as UTF-8, but if you pass an optional <code>encoding</code> argument you can override this.</p>
    <pre>txt = read("hebrew.txt")
txt = read("ozu.txt", encoding="shift-jis")</pre>
  </div>
