    <p>PlotDevice not only exports to PDF documents and images, but handles animation as well, which
    can be exported to QuickTime movies. Using the same syntax as drawing, your can turn your
    script into an animation, doing all kinds of wonderful, lively things.</p>
    <h2>The speed(), setup(), and draw() commands</h2>

    <p>For an animation to work, it needs three things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>speed()</b>: the speed() command indicates the speed of the animation in frames per
      second. Note that this is a maximum: big animations will require more work, and thus run
      slower.
      </li><li><b>setup()</b>: your own setup() definition, declaring global variables and initializing
      them.
      </li><li><b>draw()</b>: your own draw() definition, doing the actual drawing.
    </li></ul>

    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="media"><img height="586" src="../etc/tut/animation-example.jpg" width="658"/></span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>You may already know a little bit about defining your own commands from the <a href="Commands.html">Templating</a> tutorial.</p>
    <p>The setup() command is run once, at the beginning of the animation, and draw() is run on
    each <i>frame</i>, or step, in the animation. Take a look at the example above. What I’m doing
    there in the setup() definition, is declaring a <i>global variable</i> named <i>frame</i>,
    which I’m going to use later on in the draw() to keep track of the animation frame being
    rendered on the canvas. The variable needs to be a global, because otherwise setup() and draw()
    can’t communicate, or <i>share</i> the variable.</p>
    <p>Now examine the draw() definition. It’s a typical example of an animation script. The draw()
    command is called repetively by PlotDevice, rendering frame after frame of animation. In the
    example above, the draw() definition basically does four things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase the <i>frame</i> variable by one (this is my frame counter)
      </li><li>Use a colored rectangle to draw a background
      </li><li>Draw thirty rotated curves
      </li><li>Use the math sin() function to distort the curves fluidly
    </li></ul>

    <h2>Fluid movement</h2>

    <p>Notice the use of a mathematical sine function in the draw() definition. A sine is an
    <i>oscillating</i> function that yields values between -1.0 and 1.0 (and then back down to
    -1.0), but not in a linear fashion. When it reaches -1 or 1, it goes slower, and goes fastest
    when it crosses 0. This is useful for animation that <i>eases in</i> or <i>eases out</i>.</p>
    <p>To use the <b>sin()</b> function, import it from the Python math package along with the
    radians() function (sines work with radians like PI). In the example above I supply the
    <i>frame</i> variable as radians to the sine function and multiply it with a differnt number
    for each curve, which gives me a fluid distortion vector that eases in and eases out each
    curve.</p>
    <p>A sine function typically looks like this:</p>
<pre>
<span class="kw">from</span> <span class="s">math</span> <span class="kw">import</span> sin, radians
ease = sin<span class="s">(</span>radians<span class="s">(</span>x<span class="s">)</span><span class="s">)</span> * y
</pre>

    <h2>Tips for speed optimization</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>If you plan to use a lot of lines in your animation, group them in a single path with
      <a href="../ref/Drawing#lineto()">lineto()</a> and <a href="../ref/Drawing#moveto()">moveto()</a>. A single big path renders faster than many small
      paths. All the lines would have the same stroke color and width however.
      </li><li>If you plan to use a lot of text in your animation, create cached <a href="../ref/Typography#textpath()">textpath()</a> versions in the setup() command and <a href="../ref/Transform#translate()">translate()</a> those when drawing instead of repeatedly
      calling <a href="../ref/Typography#text()">text()</a> in the draw() command.
      </li><li>Tune the speed() command to exactly the speed you need. Setting it as high as possible
      often works as a drawback because then PlotDevice would attempt to update too much.
      </li><li>Tune the <a href="../ref/Setup#size()">size()</a> of the canvas to exactly what you need
      - a smaller canvas means less screen to refresh.<br/>
    </li></ul>

    <h2>Exporting as a Quicktime movie</h2>

    <p>You can export an animation as a Quicktime movie. Select ‘Export as Quicktime Movie...’ from
    the PlotDevice File menu, or press shift-apple-e. You can select a number of frames to export, and
    a movie frame rate.</p>
    <p>The Quicktime functionality in PlotDevice is based on <a href="http://undefined.org/python/">PyQTSequence</a> written by Bob Ippolito.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="media"><img height="586" src="../etc/tut/animation-export.jpg" width="658"/></span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The resulting movie is uncompressed, so it will likely be large in file size. You can
    compress it if you have Quicktime Pro, or some other movie editor.</p>
    <p>...and you have a movie to put on your website!</p>
