    <p>If you looked at the <a href="Variables.html">variables</a>, <a href="Repetition.html">repetition</a> and <a href="Commands.html">commands</a> chapters, you already know a
    great deal about how to keep your code tidy and organized. Variables can be used to store data,
    commands to manipulate data, and for-loops to do things repeatedly. As you move on to bigger projects you’ll probably want to learn about classes as well. A class is a programming convention that defines a thing (or <b>object</b>) together with all of the thing’s <b>properties</b> (e.g. variables) and behavior
    <b>methods</b> (e.g. commands). If you take a look at the source code of PlotDevice libraries
    you’ll notice that they are full of classes.</p>

    <p>For example, a <i>Creature</i> class would consist of all the traits shared by different
    creatures, such as <i>size, position</i>, <i>speed</i> and <i>direction</i> (properties), and
    <i>avoid_obstacle()</i>, <i>eat_food()</i> (methods).</p>

    <p>We can then use the Creature class to generate many different <b>instances</b> of a creature.
    For example, an ant is a small and speedy creature that wanders around randomly looking for
    food, avoiding obstacles by going around them. A dinosaur is also a creature, but bigger and
    slower. It eats anything crossing its path and avoids obstacles by crashing through them.</p>


    <h3>Classes in Python</h3>

    <p>As we saw in the <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a> chapter, there's a difference between <em>defining</em> something and <em>using</em> it. This same distinction also applies to classes: you first need to teach PlotDevice about your new object type, then later in the script you can "instantiate" as many of them as you want.</p>

    <p>Class definitions have a syntax that looks quite similar to what we've seen before. There's an line name where we set the name for our new class, then an indented block of one or more method definitions:</p>
    <pre>class ClassName:
    ... # method defintions</pre>


    <h2>Class definition and initialization</h2>

    <p>Every class has a method named <i>__init__()</i> which is <b>executed once when an instance of the
    class is created</b>. This method sets all the starting values for an object’s
    properties and defines the parameters accepted when creating new objects.</p>
    <p>For example, here’s what a simple definition of a Creature class would look like:</p>
<pre>class Creature:
    def __init__(self, x, y, speed=1.0, size=4):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.speed = speed
        self.size = size
</pre>

    <p>As you can see, a creature has <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> properties (its location in space) as well as <i>speed</i> and <i>size</i> properties (which we’ll use to move the creature
    around). Since <i>speed</i> and <i>size</i> are defined with default values, they are optional when "instantiating" a new creature.</p>
    <p>You create instances of a class by calling the class name as if it were a command, but including the parameters defined in its <i>__init__()</i> method. The one tricky bit is that you should ignore the <code>self</code> argument, since it will be filled in automatically (see below).</p>
<pre>ant = Creature(100, 100, speed=2.0)
dinosaur = Creature(200, 250, speed=0.25, size=45)
</pre>

    <p>To change a property value for a creature later on we can simply re-assign it:</p>
<pre>ant.speed = 2.5
</pre>

    <p>As with <a href="Commands.html">command names</a>, Python has some conventions for naming classes that you should try to follow:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Class names use <code>CamelCase</code> notation.</li>
      <li>Properties that are only for private use inside the class start with <code>_</code></li>
  </ul>


    <h2>Methods and the self parameter</h2>

    <p>Let’s add a <i>roam()</i> method to the Creature class to move creatures around randomly. A
    class method looks exactly like a command definition but it always takes <i>self</i> as the
    first parameter. The <i>self</i> parameter is the current instance of the class. It allows you
    to access all of an object’s current property values and methods from inside the method.</p>
<pre>class Creature:
    def __init__(self, x, y, speed=1.0, size=4):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.speed = speed
        self.size = size

        self._vx = 0
        self._vy = 0

    def roam(self):
        """ Creature changes heading aimlessly.
        """

        v = self.speed
        self._vx += random(-v, v)
        self._vy += random(-v, v)
        self._vx = max(-v, min(self._vx, v))
        self._vy = max(-v, min(self._vy, v))

        self.x += self._vx
        self.y += self._vy
</pre>

    <p>So now we have added two new properties to the class, <i>_vx</i> and <i>_vy,</i> which store
    a creature’s current heading. Both property names start with an underscore because they are for
    private use inside the class methods (i.e., no one should directly manipulate <i>ant._dx</i>
    from the outside).</p>

    <p>Each time the <i>roam()</i> method is called we add or subtract a random proportion of the creature’s
    speed from its heading, like a pinwheel twirling around randomly. We also make sure the horizontal
    and vertical "velocities" don't exceed the creature’s maximum speed. Otherwise the creature would start
    going faster and faster which isn’t very realistic. Finally, we update the creature’s position
    by stepping it toward the new heading.</p>

    <p>Now we can create two ants (a small fast one and a big slow one). Since their size and
    speed differ they will roam in different ways.</p>

<pre>ant1 = Creature(300, 300, speed=2.0)
ant2 = Creature(300, 300, speed=0.5, size=8)

speed(30)
def draw():
    ant1.roam()
    ant2.roam()
    arc(ant1.x, ant1.y, radius=ant1.size)
    arc(ant2.x, ant2.y, radius=ant2.size)
</pre>

    <h3>Case Study: "Intelligent" Agents</h3>

    <p>Now that we know the basics about classes, properties and methods, we can take things a lot
    further. We can define different classes for different things and have them interact with each
    other.</p>
    <p>If we want to have our little critters avoid obstacles while wandering around, they will need to have some sense of the world around them. Our code will need to keep track of where the obstacles are located, and the creature will need to have some sort of "feeler" so it can detect looming collisions.</p>

    <p>A feeler could be the creature’s sight, hearing, or antennae – it's really just a metaphor for the sensory feedback we'll be providing it from "the world". For our simple class it can represented as an <code>x</code>/<code>y</code> "test" point just in front of the creature's current heading. If this point falls inside an obstacle, it’s time for the creature to change its direction.</p>
    <div class="media" style="margin:0;"><img alt="classes-creature2" height="200" src="../etc/tut/classes-creature2.jpg" width="550"/></div>
    <p><i>The creature is heading into an obstacle – it can "sense" the obstacle with its
    feeler and will need to adjust its bearing clockwise to avoid colliding with it.
    </i></p>

    <h2>World class</h2>
    <p>We’ll start out by creating a World class which we can use to store a list of obstacles.
    Later on we can add all sorts of other stuff to the world (e.g. weather methods, colony
    location properties, etc.). Note that we're defining it as a class even though we'll only ever create <em>one</em> <code>World</code> object in any of our simulations.</p>
<pre>class World:
    def __init__(self):
        self.obstacles = []
</pre> 


    <h2>Obstacle class</h2>
    <p>Next we’ll define an Obstacle class. In our simulation we'll be creating a number of <code>Obstacle</code> objects and storing them in a shared <code>World</code> object. The <code>Obstacle</code> itself doesn't need to know about the world-at-large (since all it "does" is occupy space), so it only keeps track of its personal location and size:</p>
<pre>class Obstacle:
    def __init__(self, x, y, radius):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.radius = radius
</pre> 

    <h2>Geometry</h2>
    <p>To know if a creature is going to run into an obstacle we need to know <b>if the tip of its
    feeler intersects with an obstacle</b>. Obviously we’re going to need some math to calculate
    the coordinates of the tip of the feeler. Luckily everything we need is already described in
    the tutorial on <a href="Geometry.html">geometry</a>. We could use the methods provided by <a href="../ref/Misc.html#Point">Point</a> objects, but instead lets define some equivalent geometry commands that let us work with plain-old numbers:</p>
<pre>from math import degrees, atan2
from math import sqrt, pow
from math import radians, sin, cos

def angle(x0, y0, x1, y1):
    """Returns the angle between two points."""
    return degrees( atan2(y1-y0, x1-x0) )

def distance(x0, y0, x1, y1):
    """Returns the distance between two points."""
    return sqrt(pow(x1-x0, 2) + pow(y1-y0, 2))

def coordinates(x0, y0, distance, angle):
    """Returns the coordinates of given distance and angle from a point."""
    return (x0 + cos(radians(angle)) * distance,
            y0 + sin(radians(angle)) * distance)

def reflect(x0, y0, x1, y1, d=1.0, a=180):
    """Returns the coordinates of x1/y1 reflected through x0/y0"""
    d *= distance(x0, y0, x1, y1)
    a += angle(x0, y0, x1, y1)
    x, y = coordinates(x0, y0, d, a)
    return x, y
</pre> 

    <p>With the above <i>coordinates()</i> command we can:<br/></p>
    <ul>
      <li>calculate the location of a point (tip of the feeler)<br/>
      </li><li>at a given distance (feeler length)<br/>
      </li><li>along a given angle (creature heading)<br/>
      </li><li>from a starting point (creature location).
    </li></ul><br/>

    <h2>Obstacle avoidance</h2>
    <p>So first of all we’ll need to add a new <i>feeler_length</i> property to the Creature class,
    and a new <i>heading()</i> method that calculates the angle between a creature’s current
    position and its next position. We also add a new <i>world</i> property to the Creature class.
    That way each creature has access to all the obstacles in the world. We loop through the list
    of the world’s obstacles in the <i>avoid_obstacles()</i> method.</p>
    <p>The <i>avoid_obstacles()</i> method will do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>calculate the "heading" angle of a creature,
      </li><li>traverse all obstacles in the world,
      </li><li>for each obstacle, check if it is closer than the feeler length,
      </li><li>if it is, check if the coordinates of the tip of the feeler are inside the obstacle,
      </li><li>and if so, steer away in the most logical direction.
    </li></ul>
